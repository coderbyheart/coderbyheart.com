When Nordic Semiconductor flew me to Trondheim\nfor the in-person interview, I met with Ellen for the first time. I remember\nvividly how she answered all the questions I had regarding immigrating to Norway\nand gave me the confidence that there would be someone which would take care of\nall the important and annoying tasks. This was an important factor why I finally\ndecided to take the job offer. And it turned out to be absolutely true. Ellen\nand her team were meticulously planning the immigration, the move, helped with\nfinding a very nice flat according to our wishes and made sure that moving to\nNorway was a smooth experience so that we could settle as fast as possible. At\nno time did I encounter surprises. It was the first immigration for us and I\nwould do it again with Ellen and her team‚Äîeven if I had to pay for it on my own,\nthe money is very well spent.
