    <p>
      As a freelance software craftsman I help [distributed] teams to develop great software and enjoy the process, using
      my 19+ years of experience working as a software developer, consultant, coach, mentor, and founder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've built software in the past that was both robust and easy to change, so let's work together if you want your company to deliver value to your customers every day.
    </p>

      Contact me to discuss how I can help your developers, your software business, and your distributed team.
