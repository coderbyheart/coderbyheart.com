  @maaretp @EvaNanyonga I don't have heard many stories at all where
  non-technical people where actively writing these scenarios. It's extremely
  rare.


  But for me it provides a living documentation, that can be understood by
  non-developers.


  It's great to show "what's currently implemented" in plain EN.
