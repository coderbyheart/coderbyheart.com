  @katrinbretscher @emilybache Finally, I'd like to say that "software craft" is
  not a goal, but a journey, and for me the point is to have an honest
  conversation about what we do and how we do it as humans in front of computers
  and how that impacts ourselves, our coworkers, clients and society.
