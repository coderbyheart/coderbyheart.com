  @GoogleStadia I did some more missions in Destiny 2 and it occasionally lags.
  Overall a good gaming experience.


  I am not so happy with the sometimes very strong compression artefacts, but I
  guess this is inevitably when running a video stream.

[@GoogleStadia](https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia) I did some more missions in
Destiny 2 and it occasionally lags. Overall a good gaming experience.

I am not so happy with the sometimes very strong compression artefacts, but I
guess this is inevitably when running a video stream.
