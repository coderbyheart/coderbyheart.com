  @rinkkasatiainen @SoCraTes_Conf I think in general thinking about user needs
  is super important and should always come first. I should drive the next
  changes.


  I see however that there needs to be work put into discovering user needs.
  Most of the time they are not know, because users rarely take time to share.
