  @Niklas_L @chaugstvedt So, Im trying to find a screenshot, but I have recently
  used a mobile app, with a textarea and a submit button below that. Once you
  click into the textarea, the Android keyboard overlaps the submit button, and
  you weren't able to hide the keyboard without navigating away.
