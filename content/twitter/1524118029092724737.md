  @zimmskal I've also went through a few iterations, and at home now have for
  occasional work on 27". But at work, for the longest time now, very happy with
  3 smaller ones, because I can keep the 24" full in my view while still having
  ample space to the left and right.

[@zimmskal](https://twitter.com/zimmskal) I've also went through a few
iterations, and at home now have for occasional work on 27". But at work, for
the longest time now, very happy with 3 smaller ones, because I can keep the 24"
full in my view while still having ample space to the left and right.
