  @Niklas_L It has some downsides, too, but it better integrates the task with
  the technical requirements of the individual roles, so I think this achieves
  overall better aligment with company goals but also individual skills and
  capacities of teams.

[@Niklas_L](https://twitter.com/Niklas_L) It has some downsides, too, but it
better integrates the task with the technical requirements of the individual
roles, so I think this achieves overall better aligment with company goals but
also individual skills and capacities of teams.
