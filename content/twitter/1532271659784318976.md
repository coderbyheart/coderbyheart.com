  @w3ltraumpirat I have to check out the V2 version of that construct. Usually
  CDK constructs don't support async code execution so having the build step in
  the place where the construct is created would be preferred for me, but hasn't
  been possible before.

[@w3ltraumpirat](https://twitter.com/w3ltraumpirat) I have to check out the V2
version of that construct. Usually CDK constructs don't support async code
execution so having the build step in the place where the construct is created
would be preferred for me, but hasn't been possible before.
