  @martinjuhasz I am just starting with this effort, so it's one device for now.
  For now I didn't need to reset, so it's pretty stable. 

  I expect customers to have more devices, my job for now just is proof of
  concept work.


  Power-cycling USB hubs exist, so this could be put somewhere remote.
