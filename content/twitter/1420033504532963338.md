  @spazierendenken @Niklas_L @Ookami86 I also think that there is a conflict
  between avoiding individual performance goals and focusing on team based
  outcome vs. the need to pay people salaries based on an individual "rank".

  I wish more companies would start experimenting with letting teams manage
  their salaries.
