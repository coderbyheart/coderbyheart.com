  @c089 @dan_abramov If a "security" feature lets me install a backdoor it is
  broken.

  The registry should not distribute malicious code in the first place (and
  that's what they do, they remove those packages).

  The point here is that we can install packages which *might* have a security
  implication. &gt;

[@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) If a "security" feature lets me
install a backdoor it is broken. The registry should not distribute malicious
code in the first place (and that's what they do, they remove those packages).
The point here is that we can install packages which _might_ have a security
implication. &gt;
