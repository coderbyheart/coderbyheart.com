  @maaretp @AltomSays It's similar to BDD, but the advantage of using a graph is
  that you don't need to think about all the combinations, the graph will take
  care of all possible mutations.


  Very good match to Domain Driven Design: these test descriptions could be the
  outcome of Event Storming.
