  @MartinaKraus11 I know it's not ideal, but I feel this needs to be more
  publicly addressed to educate others.


  And I would not encourage women to apply to a conference like this, given this
  set of speakers, and a sorry excuse for a code of conduct.

I feel this needs to be more publicly addressed to educate others.

And I would not encourage women to apply to a conference like this, given this
set of speakers, and a sorry excuse for a code of conduct.
