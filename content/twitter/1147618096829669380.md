  @simonbrown @foofighter75 @MiroHQ @structurizr @zuehlke_group Yeah, that makes
  sense. Code can provide the elements (components, relations, descriptions) but
  some human interactions is needed to tune generated diagrams.


  I have a lot if experience with GraphViz, even there I need to manually fine
  tune the layout on complex diagrams.
