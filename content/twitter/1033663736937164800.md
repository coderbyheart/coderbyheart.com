  I now have seen people come to @SoCraTes_Conf first to improve their technical
  skill. As they transition to more senior roles they still come back to learn
  about social skills. 


  I love that we as a community can provide this holistic approach to becoming a
  better human in tech.

technical skill. As they transition to more senior roles they still come back to
learn about social skills.
