  That's a good question!

  We know that 100% code coverage should not be the goal. 

  We want to include the code paths that are not straightforward to understand,
  so unit test would provide documentation. Also good if they are prone to
  mistakes, when the code code is complex. https://t.co/aDqCbhFhVx
