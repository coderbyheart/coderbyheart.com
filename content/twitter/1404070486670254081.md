  @branaby @alterisian @borderless_dev @CuriousAgilist Sorry to hear that. The
  decision to use the @DistributeAid code base was made on such short notice for
  me that I couldn't block out more time for the event. I, too, think there
  should be people available who are familiar with the project.
