  @kohidave @clare_liguori I think CF is already great (in terms of what
  solves), but a feature I miss most is actually beyond its scope: time to
  deploy. Ideally it should deploy 100x faster.

  Wish two would be support for deploying lambdas from Typescript without
  needing to figure out the packaging part.
