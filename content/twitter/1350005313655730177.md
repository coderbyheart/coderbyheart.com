  After reading @sindresorhus tweet I am a little bit torn to move @bifravst to
  pure ESM. The benefits are a little hard to justify, especially because it
  means that some tooling needs to be replaced (e.g. jest) and other need not so
  clean workaround (e.g. need .cjs config files). https://t.co/iL8bNFozrs
