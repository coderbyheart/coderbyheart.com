  @jayallanjethwa Yes, for detecting misunderstandings I use principles from
  non-violent communication and 4 sides model: 

  first introspect to see if I am getting triggered and my feelings overshadow
  actual meaning, and always double check for assumptions. Helps me a lot to not
  let things boil.
