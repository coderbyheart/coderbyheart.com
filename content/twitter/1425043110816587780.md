  @troubalex @pati_gallardo @DistributeAid From our Slack today: "Hey all! Just
  a friendly reminder, when you are on Notion, please do NOT unlock any
  databases! Notion is rather glitchy and if a property is deleted then it can
  disrupt all of the links between databases and make various pages not function
  how they should."
