  @NicolaLindgren I try to create a very low barrier to opt out. I literally ask
  them to "please say no or ignore" my request. OTOH I also invest in scoping
  the request clearly.


  I personally have no problem with saying no. I have to be in charge of my
  time, nobody else can do this for me.
