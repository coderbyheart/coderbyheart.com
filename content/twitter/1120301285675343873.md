  @ipreuss @benjamin @datenreisender Thanks, I'm not used to that. Giving tech
  related talks makes it easy to let results speak for themselves. But I guess
  it's worth looking into adding personal anecdotes here, because they *are* the
  result (albeit in the end only heresay).

because they _are_ the result (albeit in the end only heresay).
