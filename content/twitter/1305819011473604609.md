  I am grateful for what @mimismash did in this thread. I don't wish anyone to
  dig through this pile of shit, but the sheer amount of WTFs per Tweet in there
  should serve as a reminder who the more ignorant parts of our industry keep
  giving a stage. This harms all of us. https://t.co/R6CRG3NsrK
