  @Lynoure It's quite nice for the consumer, they have complete freedom on what
  they want, how they want it. But this puts a lot of work on the backend to
  make the responses snappy. REST is very much architecture driven, GraphQL is
  domain driven. Both have advantages.

[@Lynoure](https://twitter.com/Lynoure) It's quite nice for the consumer, they
have complete freedom on what they want, how they want it. But this puts a lot
of work on the backend to make the responses snappy. REST is very much
architecture driven, GraphQL is domain driven. Both have advantages.
