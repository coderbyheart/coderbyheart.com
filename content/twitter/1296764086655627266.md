  @fquednau @NordicTweets We use both stacks (and other) to build fronteds here,
  e.g. React on our Electron based nRF Connect for Desktop.

  This role will be working more on our internal tools, which uses VueJS (not
  exclusively, btw). 

  We have a lot of freedom to pick the tech, so this is not a must!
