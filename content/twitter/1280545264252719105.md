  @Zhuinden Listen, RCM is perpetuating white supremacists ideas, has been
  supporting transphobes and been proven to be a misogynist. He is one of the
  most prominent people in the software industry, which I am part of, so I have
  the right to point out behaviour that is unacceptable.

[@Zhuinden](https://twitter.com/Zhuinden) Listen, RCM is perpetuating white
supremacists ideas, has been supporting transphobes and been proven to be a
misogynist. He is one of the most prominent people in the software industry,
which I am part of, so I have the right to point out behaviour that is
unacceptable.
