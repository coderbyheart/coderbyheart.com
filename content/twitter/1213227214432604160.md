  @bitandbang IME it happens not very often that PRs contain a swath of unwanted
  files, after all it only happens if developers blindly add files.

  And it's easy to spot if a PR adds a lot of files.

  But I see that if you only have one project a large blocklist-like .gitignore
  can be beneficial.
