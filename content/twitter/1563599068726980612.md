  Really cool from Benjamin to sit down with me, and he actually had a great
  tip! My biggest problem ist Azure AD B2C not being automatically deployable,
  and the tip was to share it between multiple instances of my project (which is
  deployed for testing). #SoCraTes2022 https://t.co/7WB03D9NCY
