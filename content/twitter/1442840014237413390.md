  @Tobias_Mende Yeah, I do. It's all fine, it's a candidate market so there is a
  huge competition out there, especially from companies who pay US salaries for
  remote positions.

  I started hiring 8 months ago for a senior role, so I am not surprised that it
  didn't work out. So I need to adapt.
