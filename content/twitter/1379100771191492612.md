  @spazierendenken @ianrohdebell I learned programming in German, with German
  books, and some online resources in German, and even in 2009 when I studied CS
  in Germany, all course material was in German. This form of local education is
  still true for many universities around the world.

@spazierendenken [@ianrohdebell](https://twitter.com/ianrohdebell) I learned
programming in German, with German books, and some online resources in German,
and even in 2009 when I studied CS in Germany, all course material was in
German. This form of local education is still true for many universities around
the world.
