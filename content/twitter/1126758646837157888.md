  @malk_zameth @jasongorman @GeePawHill @yakhyadabo I hope that conferences will
  focus more on practicioners and help them to share their experiences. 


  I find unconferences like @SoCraTes_Conf much more effective to learn from
  discussion in a safe space instead of listening to polished conference talks.
