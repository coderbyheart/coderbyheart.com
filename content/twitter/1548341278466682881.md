  I have a @NordicTweets Thingy:91 with me and since we've added A-GPS and P-GPS
  support the time it takes to acquire a fix has been so much faster and more
  reliable that you see a nice trail. The time to fix limit is set to 60 seconds
  for this device and is usually around 5. https://t.co/AiRBYgc5aS
