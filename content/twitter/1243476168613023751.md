  @TheRealBudt @pati_gallardo I am no bioethicist nor a doctor, so what I mean
  with "acceptable deathrate" is the time when when vaccination and treatments
  are available and the deathrate for people who contract COVID-19 are similar
  to that of the seasonal flu or any other disease. 

  Does that make more sense?
