  @franzen_simon I think they are laying a barrier in front of the brown wooden
  house on the ground of the river. The house is very old and slanted and I
  think they want to build a support structure to keep it from collapsing
  eventually.

[@franzen_simon](https://twitter.com/franzen_simon) I think they are laying a
barrier in front of the brown wooden house on the ground of the river. The house
is very old and slanted and I think they want to build a support structure to
keep it from collapsing eventually.
