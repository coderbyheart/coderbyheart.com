  I can say from my own experience with ICANN, that it is really ambiguous, on
  the one hand you have these big, open, steering groups, and a lot of
  enthusiastic people really trying to reach out and hear many opinions, on the
  other hand you need to know the right people. https://t.co/RZjomilCn8
