  @iamjoyheron I was calling myself a full-stack developer for a very long time,
  only recently did I think that and have now been think of being a full-stack
  literate: I _know_ the entire stack, but I can only really excel at
  backend/architecture.

full-stack developer for a very long time, only recently did I think that and
have now been think of being a full-stack literate: I _know_ the entire stack,
but I can only really excel at backend/architecture.
