  @Der_Pesse I don't know Andrea, but in a majoral cis-white-male organization,
  committees can easily become blocked or subverted by nay-sayers and hidden
  power 

  play, for me this re-affirmation of the person that is hired for DEI work is
  actually a good thing.

majoral cis-white-male organization, committees can easily become blocked or
subverted by nay-sayers and hidden power play, for me this re-affirmation of the
person that is hired for DEI work is actually a good thing.
