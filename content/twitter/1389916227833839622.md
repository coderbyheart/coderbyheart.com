  @_francied I'm actually thinking about making a social network around showing
  connections of people who mutually would love working together at the same
  company. That would be such an opportunity for companies to be more deliberate
  about hiring teams, or people who work well together.

[@\_francied](https://twitter.com/_francied) I'm actually thinking about making
a social network around showing connections of people who mutually would love
working together at the same company. That would be such an opportunity for
companies to be more deliberate about hiring teams, or people who work well
together.
