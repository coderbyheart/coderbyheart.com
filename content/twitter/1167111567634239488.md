  Mirjam wrote a beautiful post about what makes @SoCraTes_Conf such a unique
  place.

  And how heartbreaking the real world is.


  No coincidence that we called it a "place for utopias" this year.

  I hope that we got to inspire more people to work on making these utopias
  reality. https://t.co/ilVGo224re
