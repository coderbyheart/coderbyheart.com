  @untertanaermel @0xPIT If organizations let themselves being dragged down by
  naysayers and people who don't care about their job, they can still make a
  living out of it. But they will never exel and fail to attract and keep
  talent.

still make a living out of it. But they will never exel and fail to attract and
keep talent.
