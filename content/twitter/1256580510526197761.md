  @m4nl5r @TonyBologni Same here, I also used to work in a team with 9 hour TZ
  difference, so what makes more sense is to do TBD with a lot of automated
  checks and then sync together an hour or so to talk about critical changes.

  Devs leave ego at home so others can change their work without conflict.
