  @netzvagabund @emsuiko You could time-box it: make a list of all the topics
  you want to learn and distill that down to ~10 if there too many. Then spent a
  short time (1-2 hours) per topic to learn about the basics (watch an Intro
  video on YT or do the Getting Started guide if it's software).
