  @tdpauw I think many forget that it's not a binary thing. If they have
  critical code, they can set up notifications for that, so nothing slips
  through. But most code changes are fine, and speed has more benefits than
  having 100% peer-reviewed code.

[@tdpauw](https://twitter.com/tdpauw) I think many forget that it's not a binary
thing. If they have critical code, they can set up notifications for that, so
nothing slips through. But most code changes are fine, and speed has more
benefits than having 100% peer-reviewed code.
