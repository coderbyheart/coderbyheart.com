  @MattBolton365 If it were an actual transparent marketplace, drivers could
  make better decisions about prices and not get cut off.

  Uber abuses it's power to put drivers against each other and minimize driver
  wages. That is not a fair market.

[@MattBolton365](https://twitter.com/MattBolton365) If it were an actual
transparent marketplace, drivers could make better decisions about prices and
not get cut off. Uber abuses it's power to put drivers against each other and
minimize driver wages. That is not a fair market.
