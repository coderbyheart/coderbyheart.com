  This is a picture from yesterday: crafters in the #moria refugee camp made
  6.000 masks to go directly to be distributed there.

  This is enabled by a @DistributeAid campaign started together with Team
  Humanity to raise funds for the makers in the camp.

  I hope it can continue. https://t.co/juFPeT3pPd
