  @pati_gallardo So it's important to have unit-level tests and jest is a good
  framework for that. It's also magnitudes faster to test here. I know TDD
  fanatics who entirely stopped using Cypress because the efforts to maintain it
  *in addition to unit tests* often outweigh the gains.

[@pati_gallardo](https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo) So it's important to have
unit-level tests and jest is a good framework for that. It's also magnitudes
faster to test here. I know TDD fanatics who entirely stopped using Cypress
because the efforts to maintain it _in addition to unit tests_ often outweigh
the gains.
