  @m4nl5r @DarthB86 Complexity of running services in cloud is much more complex
  for them compare to running it on prem.

  They have very predictable load patterns, no need for scalability cloud
  offers.

  Paying 500k gets them no good support at AWS, but amazing support at their
  datacenter.
