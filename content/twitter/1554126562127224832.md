  @tbrasington @ilpeach I have that aproach on a Gatsby Powered site: the
  original are in the source code there, but I have a hook that uploads these

[@ilpeach](https://twitter.com/ilpeach) I have that aproach on a Gatsby Powered
site: the original are in the source code there, but I have a hook that uploads
these images automatically to [@contentful](https://twitter.com/contentful), so
the source of truth is the Git repo, and not the headless CMS.
