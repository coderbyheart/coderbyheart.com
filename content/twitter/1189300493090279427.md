  I was actually not aware of this but we got word a few days ago that one of
  the @dotHIV domains was subject to an attack because I configured the wildcard
  subdomain to point to GitHub. This allowed the attacker to host their content
  on a subdomain. It's by design. Here is why: https://t.co/TsieennjLC
