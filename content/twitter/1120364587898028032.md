  @M1ke @J7mbo Yes, thanks for sharing this! I guess we lack the skills and
  therefore the actual words to describe what we experienced. We don't have
  models / systems at hand we consciously apply. Communication / Conflict
  resolution happens more or less by accident and is not easy to reproduce.
