  Is there a @code extension that allows to apply changes suggested in a PR?

Is there a [@code](https://twitter.com/code) extension that allows to apply
changes suggested in a PR? Looked at
[@teamcodestream](https://twitter.com/teamcodestream) and the official @GitHub
extension, but both only show suggestions as comments.
