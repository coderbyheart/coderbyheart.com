  @RidingWolf @NordicTweets @Dell @XBowstech @LogitechG Quite good so far, still
  not typing at full speed but I don't need any more help finding special
  characters (I am not only switching to blind caps but also to US layout). I am
  now working all day on it and also taking it home. I should have bought two
  ;-)
