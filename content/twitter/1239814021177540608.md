  @alterisian @steely_glint @AdSidera For that a live video chat works best,
  Google Hangouts is free, @zoom_us not but allows recording and has IMO better
  video quality and better pre-scheduling of meetings (e.g. you can stream
  recording of talks and then have the speaker be in the room for Q&amp;A).
