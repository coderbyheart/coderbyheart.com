  @Argorak Not sure how it is a failure of the platform (web browser engine),
  that it needs a lot of resources to make the mess that's web standards work. I
  guess this is your point, we *could* write better standards, and better
  implementations of those, but then again could we really?

[@Argorak](https://twitter.com/Argorak) Not sure how it is a failure of the
platform (web browser engine), that it needs a lot of resources to make the mess
that's web standards work. I guess this is your point, we _could_ write better
standards, and better implementations of those, but then again could we really?
