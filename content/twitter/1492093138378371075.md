  @Argorak Not sure how it is a failure of the platform (web browser engine),
  that it needs a lot of resources to make the mess that's web standards work. I
  guess this is your point, we *could* write better standards, and better
  implementations of those, but then again could we really?

[@Argorak](https://twitter.com/Argorak) Not sure how it is a failure of the

standards, and better implementations of those, but then again could we really?
