  @mirjam_diala I remember very clearly when  needed to let go of Neo, and a few
  months later Trinity.


  They give us so much and at some point it's our responsibility to let them go.
  We owe them that much.


  They are unique and not just pets, but companions. That's what we love them
  for.
