  @mnt_io @mattsches @Espruino Having JS on the device means it's super easy to
  develop, and you can power down the Espruino: https://t.co/98HgcbQ3Cb


  So you have both worlds: interactive development with instant feedback, and ÂµA
  power consumption in "standby".


  Price is also great, and it has WiFi.
