  @idanmelamed @ynab We started tracking expenses basically 17 years ago, and
  developed a very good idea about unnecessary spendings, which we then could
  invest. We payed an independent financial advisor to assist us check the
  existing contracts. Today we still mostly have non-stock based funds.
