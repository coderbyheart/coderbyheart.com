  I've switched to @snyksec from @greenkeeperio but still haven't found it to be
  reliable in updating dependencies.

  It does create PRs for *some* dependencies (https://t.co/2PbdMMdFrS) but not
  for others (e.g. aws-sdk, which is also a regular dependency and had minor
  releases). https://t.co/zdoDI4NWud
