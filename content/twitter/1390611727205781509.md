  @JamieMariaS I agree, to few conference talks are about architecture. 

  I am desperate enough to run a session on every unconference I go to and show
  the architecture of a project I am working on, doing a walk through, just to
  inspire confidence in people to start sharing more.

[@JamieMariaS](https://twitter.com/JamieMariaS) I agree, to few conference talks
are about architecture. I am desperate enough to run a session on every
unconference I go to and show the architecture of a project I am working on,
doing a walk through, just to inspire confidence in people to start sharing
more.
