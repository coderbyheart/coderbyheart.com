  Given a log output (from a test run on real hardware), I want to express
  assertions against these logs.

  Are there any existing test frameworks that use that approach?

  It's like #BDD testing, but without any interaction (the firmware can be
  configured to behave in a certain way). https://t.co/T1p1MQ2Y3j
