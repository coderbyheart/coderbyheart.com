  @rradczewski @jezenthomas I want to see the first one, because the opposite is
  worse.


  The second one, I don't like. Why not use prose in the words of he domain. If
  it needs a longer explanation, it also should go into a accompanying technical
  document, because that one can be omptimized for reading.
