  @timonsku I had an XPS13 from 2016 and no issues, except the keyboard was
  replaced once after 3 years. Was really happy with that one, but it's just too
  slow today.

[@timonsku](https://twitter.com/timonsku) I had an XPS13 from 2016 and no
issues, except the keyboard was replaced once after 3 years. Was really happy
with that one, but it's just too slow today.
