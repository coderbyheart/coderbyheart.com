  @_francied I have a written lists of questions I ask every candidate, and
  technical assignments which make sure that I have similar more objective data
  for every applicant.

  The "do they match our team and company" question is decided in the team, so I
  don't have too much singular influence.

[@\_francied](https://twitter.com/_francied) I have a written lists of questions
I ask every candidate, and technical assignments which make sure that I have
similar more objective data for every applicant. The "do they match our team and
company" question is decided in the team, so I don't have too much singular
influence.
