  @EmmaWedekind It's your job, but with some extra challenges I do not face as a

  I appreciate this because I know from talking to female engineers how this can
  wear down the joy in our line of work.

extra challenges I do not face as a white man. I appreciate this because I know
from talking to female engineers how this can wear down the joy in our line of
work.
