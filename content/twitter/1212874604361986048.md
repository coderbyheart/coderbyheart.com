  One tool to rule them all? 


  Today I'd say @github:

  I really love the Trello-like simplicity and integration with issues of GitHub
  projects (https://t.co/m2DDQKqx2x)

  GitHub team discussions (https://t.co/Ptg8ox6kYQ) is actually quite good (only
  a watercooler-type chat is missing) https://t.co/8ivCfdtQks
