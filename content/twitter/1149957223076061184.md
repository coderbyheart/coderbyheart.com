  @c089 @dan_abramov And the package manager has no way of telling how the code
  is actually used.


  There I think we can have the developer "mute" specific vulnerabilities, like
  you can do for linting.


  If you look at the current warnings, a rough separation between dev and
  non-dev will reduce noise.
