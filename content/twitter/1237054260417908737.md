  @RealIvanSanchez @NordicTweets Thing is, I see a lot of new cell ids, which
  are not even resolved by commercial providers that we use, so this is made
  especially for these situations where new networks are being built, or set up
  ad-hoc (like for trade shows), or have rapidly changing cell ideas (e.g.
  China).
