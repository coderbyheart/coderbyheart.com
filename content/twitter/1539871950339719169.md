  @EdyBolos @femtoduino @JacobusSystems I expect a candidate to spend around 8
  hours on the technical challenges. It's much less time compared to before
  where we would fly people to Norway to have physical interviews. ICYDN I tell
  candidates that they can propose a different way to assess their technical
  skills.
