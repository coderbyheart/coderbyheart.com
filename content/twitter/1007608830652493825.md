  @kolencherry This menu is scarily huge. Since I need to scroll I don't have
  all options visible, makes it harder to navigate. Especially for beginners, if
  I'm looking for an entry and don't yet know where it is located.

I need to scroll I don't have all options visible, makes it harder to navigate.
Especially for beginners, if I'm looking for an entry and don't yet know where
it is located.
