  @RealIvanSanchez I think this is the point of pointing out crap: making known
  that there are better alternatives. If that turns into a conflict, that means
  that you might need to explain the "why" better. Sometimes people take a while
  or need a different medium to understand.

[@RealIvanSanchez](https://twitter.com/RealIvanSanchez) I think this is the
point of pointing out crap: making known that there are better alternatives. If
that turns into a conflict, that means that you might need to explain the "why"
better. Sometimes people take a while or need a different medium to understand.
