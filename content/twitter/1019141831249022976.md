  @dtanzer @eugen_kiss @jitterted Not yet, but will do!. One critique I have is
  the simplified view of what Integration tests cover vs. unit tests.
  @eugen_kiss uses this image which is IMO missing a third dimension.
  Integration tests will not cover code in the same depth as integration tests.
