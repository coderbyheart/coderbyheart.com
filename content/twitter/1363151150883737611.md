  @48nairda @FlyBehaviour @FHillemann You offer a personal anecdote saying that
  if women are charismatic (meaning pleasing to you personal standards) you will
  listen to them. Therefore it's not the mens fault that women don't get to talk
  a fair amount of time, it's because women are not pleasing the men enough.
