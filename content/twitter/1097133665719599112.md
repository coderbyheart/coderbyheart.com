  @EmmaWedekind And my mantra is: it's the right time when it is done, not
  earlier. I'm not getting paid for it,  but it's my spare time, so it better be
  a good time for me as well and should not stress me out.

[@EmmaWedekind](https://twitter.com/EmmaWedekind) And my mantra is: it's the
right time when it is done, not earlier. I'm not getting paid for it, but it's
my spare time, so it better be a good time for me as well and should not stress
me out.
