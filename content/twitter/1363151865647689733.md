  @48nairda @FlyBehaviour @FHillemann This is some A-grade sexist bullshit and
  turns women into subjects of arbitrary male standards. This is one of the key
  problems with our industry: men don't see the problem and all issues can
  easily be addressed, but in a "nice" way.

  This is fucking ridiculous.
