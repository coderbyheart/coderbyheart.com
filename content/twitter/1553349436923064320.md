  @maaretp I don't think there is a good answer if you are an employee and not a
  solo-freelancer, you are supposed to work with others, and you create value by
  multiplying your skills with others. And organizations are successfull because
  of this sum-of-all-is-bigger-than-individual-parts.

[@maaretp](https://twitter.com/maaretp) I don't think there is a good answer if
you are an employee and not a solo-freelancer, you are supposed to work with
others, and you create value by multiplying your skills with others. And
organizations are successfull because of this
sum-of-all-is-bigger-than-individual-parts.
