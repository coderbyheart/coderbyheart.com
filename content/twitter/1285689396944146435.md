  @jacek_smolak Once I am satisfied, I typically clamp the new code from two
  sides: I add end-to-end feature tests (BDD) which cover the entire solution,
  and I add unit and integration tests for parts of the code that's not trivial,
  while cleaning up and modularizing the it.

[@jacek_smolak](https://twitter.com/jacek_smolak) Once I am satisfied, I
typically clamp the new code from two sides: I add end-to-end feature tests
(BDD) which cover the entire solution, and I add unit and integration tests for
parts of the code that's not trivial, while cleaning up and modularizing the it.
