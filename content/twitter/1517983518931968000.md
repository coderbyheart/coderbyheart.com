  @AdharaIT @jrosaproenca When we left Monday two weeks ago we still had snow
  outside of our apartment. Going from that to beach weather and fresh orange
  juice is a stark contrast. It's not our first time in Portugal and we really
  love it here. Working remotely from here sounds super amazing!
