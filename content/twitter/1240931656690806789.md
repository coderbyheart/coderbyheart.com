  @KlaraMiffili Yeah, easter is coming up, and I expect the same here ...


  Last weekend a bus line to a ski are needed to be shut down, because it was
  too full.

  A person in quarantine broke their leg in that ski area as well.

  A city sent SMS to all people in a shopping mall, because it too full.
