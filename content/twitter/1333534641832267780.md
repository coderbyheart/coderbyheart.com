  @theTorfinnOlsen @NordicTweets @ImaginationTech We have not announced any
  products, yet, but given that LTE and WiFi are on different frequencies it
  will most likely be able to be controlled individually, like with LTE and BLE.

  Typically it won't make much sense to have both LTE and WiFi at the same time
  anyway.
