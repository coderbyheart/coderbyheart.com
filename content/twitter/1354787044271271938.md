  @pati_gallardo You can place a bet on a stock to have a certain price by a
  certain date: I sell you 1000 shares of Stock X for $1000 by 1.1.2021. You
  agree.


  Now, if by 1.1.2021 the stock price is below $1 per shared, I make a profit,
  because I can buy them for a lower price on the market.
