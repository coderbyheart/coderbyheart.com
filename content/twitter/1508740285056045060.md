  @c089 @Niklas_L @chaugstvedt @AWSAmplify Well there is no real integration.
  The Amplify components wrap my react component and either render it (if
  authenticated) or their UI stuff. You would need to figure out how to fake the
  auth state of this 3rd party component. It's possible but hacky.
