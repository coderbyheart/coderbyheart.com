  @pati_gallardo I always equate "best practice" with "for a certain group of

  It's never the best solution.

  It's never guaranteed to still work.

  Its context always matters.

practice" with "for a certain group of people this worked in the past".

It's never the best solution. It's never guaranteed to still work. Its context
always matters.
