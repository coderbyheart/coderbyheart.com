  @HTTP_420 They are not hard to maintain, people are too lazy to keep them up
  to date. 

  If everyone makes a habit of reading and checking the few remaining *useful*
  comments in the source code  every time they work on it they will be
  maintained with the code.

[@HTTP_420](https://twitter.com/HTTP_420) They are not hard to maintain, people
are too lazy to keep them up to date. If everyone makes a habit of reading and
checking the few remaining _useful_ comments in the source code every time they
work on it they will be maintained with the code.
