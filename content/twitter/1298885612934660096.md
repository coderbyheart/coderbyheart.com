  In normal circumstances I would be on my way to @SoCraTes_Conf where I'd spend
  a long weekend around many amazing people, meet friends and make new ones.

  Today I feel ðŸ’” that we don't get this safe space where we can freely speak
  about our fears and challenges. We could use that. https://t.co/nQ1H12DnRA
