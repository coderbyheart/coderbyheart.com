  @KlaraMiffili Going down to individual tickets IMO makes no sense because as
  you rightfully see work for a whole thing is hard to separate per issues.


  You need to tell the client how much time was spent by the team on each
  feature per sprint, more granularity is useless bureaucracy.

[@KlaraMiffili](https://twitter.com/KlaraMiffili) Going down to individual
tickets IMO makes no sense because as you rightfully see work for a whole thing
is hard to separate per issues.

You need to tell the client how much time was spent by the team on each feature
per sprint, more granularity is useless bureaucracy.
