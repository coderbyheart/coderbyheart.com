  @_francied It's such a great reminder how obscure the technology can be we are
  creating every day, when they struggle with the concepts. This provides great
  feedback for me, where to improve and also provides me with great
  opportunities to become better at explaining it.

[@\_francied](https://twitter.com/_francied) It's such a great reminder how
obscure the technology can be we are creating every day, when they struggle with
the concepts. This provides great feedback for me, where to improve and also
provides me with great opportunities to become better at explaining it.
