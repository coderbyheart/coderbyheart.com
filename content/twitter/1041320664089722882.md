  @CuriousAgilist From recent personal experience and from close friends I would
  say that we are not there yet. 

  Obv. this a very simplified diagnosis. But I keep seeing that it's favoured to
  quantify performance using short-term KPIs (spendings, units of work done) vs.
  measuring customer impact.
