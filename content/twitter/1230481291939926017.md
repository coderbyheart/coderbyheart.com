  @RealIvanSanchez @NordicTweets AFAIR the decision to send NMEA dates two years
  back when we were sending SIMULATED data from the device, not using the GPS,
  so there was no raw GPS data to begin with.

  In presence of higher priorities and simplicity in the SDK it was kept as is
  when using the real GPS sensor.
