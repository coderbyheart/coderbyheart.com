  @gdinwiddie I deliberately made this classification, because many have argued
  in the past with him and he did not show any interest in change. I have been
  following him for years and only witnessed a downward spiral. I'm confident
  that the classification is justified.

[@gdinwiddie](https://twitter.com/gdinwiddie) I deliberately made this
classification, because many have argued in the past with him and he did not
show any interest in change. I have been following him for years and only
witnessed a downward spiral. I'm confident that the classification is justified.
