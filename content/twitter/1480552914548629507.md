  @OwlCowl While I like the positive framing, it downplays the likelyhood of a
  serious event that makes a person unavailable.


  The odds of winning a life-altering amount in the lottery is ~1/10M, however
  around 1/1000 people have died at the age of 40.

[@OwlCowl](https://twitter.com/OwlCowl) While I like the positive framing, it
downplays the likelyhood of a serious event that makes a person unavailable.

around 1/1000 people have died at the age of 40.
