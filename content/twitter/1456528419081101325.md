  @goosebumps4 I'm leaning more towards the Flair Pro 2. After all I usually
  make Espresso for two people at the same time and that is not possible with
  the 9 Barista.

  But I'd love to have one just for the steampunk aesthetics.

Flair Pro 2. After all I usually make Espresso for two people at the same time
and that is not possible with the 9 Barista. But I'd love to have one just for
the steampunk aesthetics.
