  @KlaraMiffili Never give up, but always be weary of tunnel vision, especially
  with deadlines.

  If I am stuck on something for more than half a day, it's time to take a
  break, and explain the problem to a coworker (or a ðŸ¦†) or in another way
  collect thoughts. That usually reveals the next step.
