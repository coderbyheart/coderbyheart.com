  @Tweet_Cassandra I have been using custom email domains for a very long time
  (since 2001) in all possible configurations. I currently use @mailbox_org and
  the software they run (https://t.co/FS5SZYRAlc) I had also used at the Fintech
  I was CTO at. It is okay, but not pleasant in day to day use.
