  @Paratron @Bahnhofsoma @storchp @SmartBear @Atlassian @trello That is too
  detailed and too job specific to keep in one tool. It should be the person who
  is in charge of doing it that keeps that list, in the way that suits them
  best. 

  Keep in Trello what really needs to be seen by all stakeholders.
