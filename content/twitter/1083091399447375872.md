  At this year's #codefreeze our very own @rinkkasatiainen took us on a special
  trip: we spent a night outside at -19°C in an open shelter in the national
  park. A truly unique experience within the many magical things you can have
  here. Thank you! 

  More pics after the fold! https://t.co/oo8IyXWofZ
