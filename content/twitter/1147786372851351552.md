  @MeneDev @MiroHQ For me the C4 diagrams serve to visualise facts, not as
  plans. They help to understand what code does and how components relate. This
  helps others who don't have the entire system in their head to make sense of
  the codebase.

  It's basically a low-res rendering of the entire code.
