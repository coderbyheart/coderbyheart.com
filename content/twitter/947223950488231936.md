  @untertanaermel Death march projects are not sustainable, and the math is very
  simple: losing employees and their knowledge costs much more than 6 month of
  operational costs. 


  But: this is not your behavior, but their decision. So you can keep doing
  these kinds of projects.

[@untertanaermel](https://twitter.com/untertanaermel) Death march projects are
not sustainable, and the math is very simple: losing employees and their
knowledge costs much more than 6 month of operational costs.

But: this is not your behavior, but their decision. So you can keep doing these
kinds of projects.
