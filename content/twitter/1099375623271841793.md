  @gazebo_c I now understand that this is not easy for me because I have a
  reservation against conflicts which stem from the way I grew up. I have the
  very negative experience that conflicts were always destructive and violent. I
  try to prevent myself and others from experiencing this again.

[@gazebo_c](https://twitter.com/gazebo_c) I now understand that this is not easy
for me because I have a reservation against conflicts which stem from the way I
grew up. I have the very negative experience that conflicts were always
destructive and violent. I try to prevent myself and others from experiencing
this again.
