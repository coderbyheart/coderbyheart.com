  @DanRea86 @SmallBizBrian @johncutlefish I also cringe when I hear a complaint.
  But then I reverse-apply non-violent-communication and try to have them share
  why they are complaining: what do they observe with the problem, how does it
  make them feel, what would make their personal situation better?
