  @friemae I gave it the look, and it's good that the CDK topology is preserved,
  but it's still only boxes and arrows. Especially in cloud native solutions the
  glue is the "meat" and this is only poorly presented in these kinds of views.

[@friemae](https://twitter.com/friemae) I gave it the look, and it's good that
the CDK topology is preserved, but it's still only boxes and arrows. Especially
in cloud native solutions the glue is the "meat" and this is only poorly
presented in these kinds of views.
