  @maaretp @S_2K @lisacrispin I think it's mostly a win win.

  Companies can hire the talent they need to be successful, and they will pay
  taxes in the company's country.

  Workers from remote pay taxes locally, and also spend part of the higher
  salary they earn locally for food, housing, leasury, etc.
