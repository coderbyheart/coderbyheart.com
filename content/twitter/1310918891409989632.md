  @byteborg @NordicTweets The price right now ($109.99 on @groupgetscom) is for
  a very low batch size (around 100 kits). This does not at all reflect what a
  device would cost when going production volume. The costs for the #nRF9160 SIP
  are around US$20 for 1 unit, but that goes down significantly.
