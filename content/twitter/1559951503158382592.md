  @petterssonsoftw Depends on your constraints. MQTT has a lot of great features
  for IoT devices.

  But if you want UDP and less weight, CoAP or LwM2M (which builds on top of
  CoAp with OSCORE) is a good choice. It also mimics a more REST oriented
  approach. I like the pub/sub model of MQTT better.
