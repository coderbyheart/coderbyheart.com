  @nause_marc I think it's fine to report issues without a patch, not everyone
  is comfortable doing that, and often takes much longer to figure it the
  solution for people not familiar with a codebase. But yelling/demanding a fast
  fix is a no go. If it's important, pay someone on bountysource.
