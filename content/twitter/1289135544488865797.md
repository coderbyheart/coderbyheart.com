  @Andrea_Hanna @toggleModal It's hard (from a listener PoV) to find something
  that has closely the catalogue as Spotify. For artists I've heard the
  @Bandcamp is way better. So in the end, buy your favourite artists music
  through their preferred platform, don't rely on monopolies to ensure fair
  compensation.
