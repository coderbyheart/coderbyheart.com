  @FiddlersCode @benjamin @herecomesjaycee @Niklas_L I think SRE are responsible
  for making IT operations boring: their goal is to reduce the number of
  surprises that happen in the organisation caused by IT systems.

  Less surprises means less unplanned work, more time to create actual value.

  This can however lead to change aversion.
