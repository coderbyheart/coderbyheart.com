  I've just refactored a project to monorepo and it turned out a classic case of
  exchanging one problem with another. 


  While we now have improved the ability to navigate code and simplified
  releasing, it involved changing the way we package releases and that now takes
  more time. https://t.co/lzQkxKl1GM
