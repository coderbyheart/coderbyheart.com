  @Argorak @Hagenburger I think there is a slight preference towards using
  "softwarecrafter" over "softwarecraftsperson", while the latter is also
  getting used regularly, especially when people use it to identify themselves.
  Crafters is way shorter than craftspeople, when speaking about a group.
