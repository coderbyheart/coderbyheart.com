  @datenreisender @progpaintings @benjamin We'll, it feels a little bit like the
  DotCom boom. Everybody would start building websites, and having one was
  already a huge value in itself. 

  So that's why so many are looking into ICOs, just as a way to raise / invest.
  Not to solve a real problem.
