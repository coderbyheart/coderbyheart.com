  @NativeWired I guess it's more practical that way. Everyone needs to go to the

  their customers. I actually trust banks more than government employees to not
  fuck this up.

way. Everyone needs to go to the bank, and they also pay for the IT
infrastructure anyway to use the system for their customers. I actually trust
banks more than government employees to not fuck this up.
