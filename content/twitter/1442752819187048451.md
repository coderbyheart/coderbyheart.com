  @nelisboucke @matteo_pierro @dtanzer However, I think testing React is because
  of React's design pretty hard (use of globals, hooks), so I believe the
  current industry standard is to use TypeScript, unit test non-react code, and
  use browser automation tools like @Cypress_io to do happy path testing.
