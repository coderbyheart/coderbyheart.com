  @toggleModal I am also in the market for an new ultra-portable ultra book.

  I own the old XPS 13 developer edition, which is very nice.

  Reviews for the new one are rather mixed (WiFi sucks), AND X1 nano has been
  rumored: https://t.co/acnowZscjH


  I think the X1 is a little too big for my taste.
