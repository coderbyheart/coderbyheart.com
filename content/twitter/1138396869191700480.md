  @lukehefson Now, if I make a list of all issues and sort by priority, that
  list is totally useless in order to figure out, which issue to focus on next,
  because there will be many issues that share the same priority.


  This is a broken way to rank issues.

[@lukehefson](https://twitter.com/lukehefson) Now, if I make a list of all
issues and sort by priority, that list is totally useless in order to figure
out, which issue to focus on next, because there will be many issues that share
the same priority.

This is a broken way to rank issues.
