  @thinkaboutconf @Tweet_Cassandra Oh, great thinking, but self-hosting videos
  is expensive... 

  That said, I'd start with offering low-res videos for direct streaming using
  the AV1 codec: https://t.co/oAO3nSIzUe (works in Chrome, too), and distribute
  hi-res / originals via Bittorrent to keep traffic costs low.
