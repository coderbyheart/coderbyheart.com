  @feffi1 @w3ltraumpirat Clean Code is a set of practices, collected based on
  the experience of a specific developer. There is no proof attached, only
  anecdotes. This makes it an opinion, which is taken as "rule" and proliferates
  as "wisdom", but it's value is mostly inflated through marketing.
