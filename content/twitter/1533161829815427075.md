  @beriberikix @nordictestdays Unfortunately only the track of the big stage was
  recorded, not all talks. So for now I can only share the slides with you:
  https://t.co/26ij4ofBwv

  ... let me know if you have any questions, not everything will be super clear
  without the audio track. I am planning a blog soon.
