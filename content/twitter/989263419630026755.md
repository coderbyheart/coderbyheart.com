  @NativeWired I really had to force myself to read it to the end.


  It's sad that he cannot understand that it is not about equality of people,
  but of chances. 


  And it's terrible to read that he is denying women a chance to make a career
  in programming, as much as he did.

[@NativeWired](https://twitter.com/NativeWired) I really had to force myself to
read it to the end.

It's sad that he cannot understand that it is not about equality of people, but
of chances.

And it's terrible to read that he is denying women a chance to make a career in
programming, as much as he did.
