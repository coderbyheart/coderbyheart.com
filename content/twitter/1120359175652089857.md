  @deborahh @zurcherart @ipreuss @xcamp But I want developers like me to realize
  that they need to look into embracing collaboration across disciplines and
  stop aiming to be the best in all areas. I find An Everyone Culture by
  Lahey/Kegan (https://t.co/hECkR7eqrK) to be a great example why "seniority" is
  a broken idea.
