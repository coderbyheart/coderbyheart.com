  @liran_tal @EuroTestingConf @goldbergyoni Yes, that's why I love going to
  conferences like @EuroTestingConf. Blog posts and singular videos are
  (rightfully) too narrow. On confs, multiple speakers will be able to cover a
  topic with more detail, and everybody on location can exchange on these ideas
  more.
