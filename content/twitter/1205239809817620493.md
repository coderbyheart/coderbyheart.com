  @itsdaneesaur It's not very straightforward, you need to upload the media file
  to S3 and then create the job.


  Here is an example I just ran:

  mp3 (HR Info Podcast): https://t.co/2L9vAnBGtz

  and the SRT file: https://t.co/uaei6Npd6P 

  I can show you how to do this yourself, or I can automate it.
