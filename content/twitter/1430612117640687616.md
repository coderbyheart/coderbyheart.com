  @fquednau Well, for example the request.user object which is set by a

  there is no way to set this properly, the only workaround is to cast it
  locally.

object which is set by a passport.js middleware. This is magic, which happens
behind the scenes and there is no way to set this properly, the only workaround
is to cast it locally.
