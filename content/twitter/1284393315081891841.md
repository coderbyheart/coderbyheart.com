  The U.S. has become an openly fascist police state. I'm not sure this can be
  fixed through the next election. Thousands of state employees are willing to
  support these practices, too. I wonder what it takes to get them to realize
  that they no longer serve their country. https://t.co/SRFkl43L7k
