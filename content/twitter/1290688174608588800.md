  If @io_matched can't be bothered to create an inclusive hiring process, then I
  won't be bothered considering them to find jobs for me or for roles in my

  This ignorance is unacceptable and might even violate anti-discrimination
  laws, if used as part of a hiring process. https://t.co/jnrgF9VMXj
