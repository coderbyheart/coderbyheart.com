  @martinjuhasz This is so bad, imagine how they could instead create a
  long-lasting bond: they tell you an area where you might improve and you do,
  then even if you find a job somewhere else, you will always remember this
  positively as a time where you got input to grow, instead of a rejection.

they could instead create a long-lasting bond: they tell you an area where you
might improve and you do, then even if you find a job somewhere else, you will
always remember this positively as a time where you got input to grow, instead
of a rejection.
