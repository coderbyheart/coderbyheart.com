  @chrmaske Yes, absolutely. I see lots of students with experience in PCB
  design, embedded development for hardware. You should reach out to
  https://t.co/NN8RHxeKbn and f.eks. advertise in https://t.co/X51UUquvN7's
  (https://t.co/lZ2eGaSvRf) Instagram. 

  They also represent software students.
