  @HaganeNoEnjinia The current impfpass is decentralized, the government does
  not issue them, and it's many doctors who update it and sign a vaccination
  using their name.


  I am saying that blockchain (or 5 of them) do not provide a unique feature for
  the distribution of vaccination status.
