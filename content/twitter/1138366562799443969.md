  @Tweet_Cassandra @mailbox_org @signalapp So my recommendation today would be:
  for a custom email (you@yourname.com), pay for the Google Apps service (if you
  are a Android / Google Drive user).

  If you are used to Apple services and apps, @mailbox_org OpenXchange instance
  works very well with all the apps (Mail, Cal)...
