  @mahoriR @GergelyOrosz I don't think the sentiment was that frontend is not
  complex or does not provide a challenging career path.


  Instead OP wanted to point out that backend heavy teams provide a great
  opportunity, which might not be there if you stay in the frontend track in
  these teams.
