  @_vojam That's not the main point of TBD, arguably you can always deploy
  branches as well.

  The point is to get rid of merge hell and foster a culture of knowledge
  sharing, because everyone needs to be aware of what is happening in the
  codebase.

[@\_vojam](https://twitter.com/_vojam) That's not the main point of TBD,
arguably you can always deploy branches as well. The point is to get rid of
merge hell and foster a culture of knowledge sharing, because everyone needs to
be aware of what is happening in the codebase.
