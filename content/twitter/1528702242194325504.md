  @MaritvanDijk77 @CarloKuip Yes, they absolutely should be. In that case I am
  adding a retry because my test runner immediately checks for the result of an
  action, however, the result is not guaranteed to be visible. So instead of
  waiting before checks like this, I use retries because it will be faster.
