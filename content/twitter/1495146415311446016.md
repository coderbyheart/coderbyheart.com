  @kaylalunita I was impressed by your openness to share and ability to invite
  others to contribute in the session you did at SoCraTes. It felt both very
  self-reflected and extremely curious about others in a very warm way.

to share and ability to invite others to contribute in the session you did at
SoCraTes. It felt both very self-reflected and extremely curious about others in
a very warm way.
