  @TomasSin4 I don't question whether there is demand for optimization. That is
  obviously always there.

  But Tesla bets that they can build something that is better than humans AND
  that it is accepted as a replacement for them. And I think that is a very bold
  bet.

demand for optimization. That is obviously always there. But Tesla bets that
they can build something that is better than humans AND that it is accepted as a
replacement for them. And I think that is a very bold bet.
