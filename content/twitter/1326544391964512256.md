Today I've converted a Create React App to <https://www.snowpack.dev/> because
the reload times on code changes got annoyingly long, and it was rather
straightforward:
<https://github.com/bifravst/device-ui/commit/08ab86c0b07e9da2d4ffef925cd517beb1f46515>

This took around 1,5 hours, while I also inlined all CDN resources.
