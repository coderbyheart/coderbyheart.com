  @SamirTalwar @w3ltraumpirat @dat_project Yes, I mentioned dat earlier. It's
  really great, the only downside is the initial time out takes to discover
  peers. 


  But this is ok if you only deploy packages to production like in lambda, where
  you have all dependencies.


  And you need a way to safely distribute the author IDs.
