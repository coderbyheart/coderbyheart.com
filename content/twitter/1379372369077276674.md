  @malk_zameth I'm definitely interested in ways to politely shut down stupid
  ideas without coming across as aggressive or as a smart-ass. 


  My usual strategy is to understand and repeat what they are trying to achieve,
  and then provide a *recommendation* what to do instead.

[@malk_zameth](https://twitter.com/malk_zameth) I'm definitely interested in
ways to politely shut down stupid ideas without coming across as aggressive or
as a smart-ass.

My usual strategy is to understand and repeat what they are trying to achieve,
and then provide a _recommendation_ what to do instead.
