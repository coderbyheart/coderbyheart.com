  @malk_zameth I'm definitely interested in ways to politely shut down stupid
  ideas without coming across as aggressive or as a smart-ass. 


  My usual strategy is to understand and repeat what they are trying to achieve,
  and then provide a *recommendation* what to do instead.

and then provide a _recommendation_ what to do instead.
