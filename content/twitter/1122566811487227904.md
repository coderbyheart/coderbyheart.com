  @EmmaWedekind I have this rule for speaking:

  25% don't care what I say

  25% already know it

  25% will be offended

  25% will learn something new


  I care about the last 25% and try to make it really count for them, all else
  are already lost causes and everything I do for them is a waste of time.
