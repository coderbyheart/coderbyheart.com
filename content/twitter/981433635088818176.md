  @Lynoure I favor composition over inheritance and keep Functions really small.

  I rather have many tiny classes than one big.

  I also prefer to have many isolated modules (@npmjs ftw!) which provide a
  strong separation of concern, so it's easier to grasp what individual
  components do.

[@Lynoure](https://twitter.com/Lynoure) I favor composition over inheritance and
keep Functions really small. I rather have many tiny classes than one big. I
also prefer to have many isolated modules ([@npmjs](https://twitter.com/npmjs)
ftw!) which provide a strong separation of concern, so it's easier to grasp what
individual components do.
