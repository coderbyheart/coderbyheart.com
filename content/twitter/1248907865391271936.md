  @SamirTalwar Humans are really good at selective hearing, which does not work
  when using headphones.


  The closest that I know resembles a more ad-hoc chat situation is @sococo
  which has a visual way of telling who is talking with whom, and it's easy to
  break out a separate convo.

[@SamirTalwar](https://twitter.com/SamirTalwar) Humans are really good at
selective hearing, which does not work when using headphones.

The closest that I know resembles a more ad-hoc chat situation is
[@sococo](https://twitter.com/sococo) which has a visual way of telling who is
talking with whom, and it's easy to break out a separate convo.
