  @troubalex I think in many ways, the Norwegian society is much more

  individual is not as important and thus will try to not deviate too much from
  the "norm".

society is much more traditional than in other countries, maybe because they are
taught that the individual is not as important and thus will try to not deviate
too much from the "norm".
