[@annevanrossum](https://twitter.com/annevanrossum) I have no idea! I am
following examples from Zephyr, and it was turned off here:
<https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/52ad9a468c1a3ae9a00d1e5aac389c5bfcf087ec/samples/sensor/dht/prj.conf#L11-L15>
... so I kept that.

Why should I not be disabled?
