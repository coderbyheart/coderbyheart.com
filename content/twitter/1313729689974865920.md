  @lxztlr I already have built multiple sites with Gatsby, and I like the
  GraphQL way of managing content and that it uses React for layout. It also
  works well with headless CMSes (I use @contentful). I don't see any downsides.
  So I'll stick with that.

[@lxztlr](https://twitter.com/lxztlr) I already have built multiple sites with
Gatsby, and I like the GraphQL way of managing content and that it uses React
for layout. It also works well with headless CMSes (I use
[@contentful](https://twitter.com/contentful)). I don't see any downsides. So
I'll stick with that.
