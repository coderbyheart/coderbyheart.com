  @JanSchfr Well, this is a new system and there are some architectural
  decisions which have to be thought through.

  We have a dozen use cases defined (from simple HTTP requests to export
  Gigabytes of data).

  I'd like to have a good understanding a'bt the implications of these
  requirements.
