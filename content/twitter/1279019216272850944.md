  @pati_gallardo @valgiNorge @hallny Oh, what the fuck. They are really twisting
  facts here. Running a vulnerability scan is not "using the source code".
  @hallny did not publish the vulnerabilities, he linked to a report on a
  platform. Did they even have a process for disclosing vulnerabilities in
  place?
