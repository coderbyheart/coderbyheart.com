  @RealIvanSanchez @NordicTweets The Mozilla thing is cool, thanks for sharing,
  but has no commercial offering or SLA, so it's not the simple plug-and-play
  solution I am looking for, but it's cool that it can be run open-source.


  I'll definitely check their database against the cells we have on record.
