  So, I checked out https://t.co/QpKXH5919Z, because who does not love PT, to
  sadly discover that they use fake quotes. "Viktor Smith

  Frontend Engineer" is obviously one of those fake, and they use
  @alexanderhipp's photo probably w/o permission.

  @landing_jobs you can do better. https://t.co/FL8R7qqMJo
