  @tasomaniac @stefanhoth @jetbrains Thanks, that page lacks explanation about
  the benefit of sharing these files ... 

  For code-style I recommend to use @PrettierCode which is nearly zero-config,
  or editorconfig which is IDE independent. Also this way code-style choices
  become explicit and can be enforced on CI.
