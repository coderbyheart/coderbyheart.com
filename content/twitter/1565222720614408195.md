  @quilaztlia @Azure But it's OK! I don't really like to talk about it anyway
  AND I got to @rinkkasatiainen's session on functional programming instead
  where we had a great exchange about his and @michelle_avomo's codebase. And
  because of Twitter @BenjaminHugot helped me after all. That's the magic!
