  @chr_horsdal The point is that many tools are designed to make asynchronous
  work easier, and if only viewed as a helper for teams that are distributed,
  but in the same timezone, provide no benefit.


  Think mobprogramming: it's a tool without an alternative if you can't work
  synchronously.
