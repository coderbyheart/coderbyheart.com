  @VolkerGoebbels I've read the comments and I do understand the argument for
  putting it in the repo. It makes sense for projects that deal with a lot
  inexperienced or untrained contributors.


  But looking at the number of likes and RTs most seem to want clean gitignore
  files.

projects that deal with a lot inexperienced or untrained contributors.

But looking at the number of likes and RTs most seem to want clean gitignore
files.
