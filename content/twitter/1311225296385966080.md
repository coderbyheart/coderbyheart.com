  @pati_gallardo When dealing with JSON I move that code into a function which
  ensures the the data is correct (or knows it for a fact), and returns typed
  values to the rest of the application, so one does not need to deal with
  untyped values in the rest of the code.

it for a fact), and returns typed values to the rest of the application, so one
does not need to deal with untyped values in the rest of the code.
