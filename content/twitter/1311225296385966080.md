  @pati_gallardo When dealing with JSON I move that code into a function which
  ensures the the data is correct (or knows it for a fact), and returns typed
  values to the rest of the application, so one does not need to deal with
  untyped values in the rest of the code.

move that code into a function which ensures the the data is correct (or knows
it for a fact), and returns typed values to the rest of the application, so one
