  @MaritvanDijk77 I try to make this a habit during work time. Because it is
  part of my job therefore I should be able to learn new skills for work on
  work-time. If not, it's a signal that my organization is on crunch-time too
  much and won't move forward.

[@MaritvanDijk77](https://twitter.com/MaritvanDijk77) I try to make this a habit
during work time. Because it is part of my job therefore I should be able to
learn new skills for work on work-time. If not, it's a signal that my
organization is on crunch-time too much and won't move forward.
