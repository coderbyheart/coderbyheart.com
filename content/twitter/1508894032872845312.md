  @borderless_dev I imaging code layed out on an infinite three-dimensional
  canvas which is self arranging according to the flow of data, and you can
  easily jump between code segments that are connected, and also have a instant
  way of filtering / teleporting anywhere with a few keystrokes.

[@borderless_dev](https://twitter.com/borderless_dev) I imaging code layed out
on an infinite three-dimensional canvas which is self arranging according to the
flow of data, and you can easily jump between code segments that are connected,
and also have a instant way of filtering / teleporting anywhere with a few
keystrokes.
