  My roaming provider in Germany for @chess_no is @o2de and as soon as you are
  around Frankfurt central station the internet connection drops. 


  It's still the same horrible network service I used to hate in 2012 when I was
  an O2 customer.

My roaming provider in Germany for [@chess_no](https://twitter.com/chess_no) is
@o2de and as soon as you are around Frankfurt central station the internet
connection drops.

It's still the same horrible network service I used to hate in 2012 when I was
an O2 customer.
