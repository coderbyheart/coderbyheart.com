  @malk_zameth I think this is a very good waterfall metaphor: you have planned
  out the whole thing from start to finish, only to realize half way through
  that it takes too long to eat an entire wheel of cheese because it starts
  rotting as soon as you cut the first slice.

[@malk_zameth](https://twitter.com/malk_zameth) I think this is a very good
waterfall metaphor: you have planned out the whole thing from start to finish,
only to realize half way through that it takes too long to eat an entire wheel
of cheese because it starts rotting as soon as you cut the first slice.
