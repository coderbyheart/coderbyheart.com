  @dan_abramov It has been a downward spiral since @zkat__ left basically. They
  were really great at including the community, and npm never made a visible
  effort to keep it that way.


  Just look at this reply: https://t.co/TeWQs2B4uR ... they moved to development
  behind closed doors basically.
