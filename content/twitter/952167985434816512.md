  @miskaknapek I did not fly via HEL, because there is a direct flight from FRA
  to IVL (seriously!).


  But I keep that in mind. I have colleagues in Oulu, and I'll probably need to
  fly to Finland again this year.

[@miskaknapek](https://twitter.com/miskaknapek) I did not fly via HEL, because
there is a direct flight from FRA to IVL (seriously!).

But I keep that in mind. I have colleagues in Oulu, and I'll probably need to
fly to Finland again this year.
