  @nelisboucke @rinkkasatiainen @RidingWolf @w3ltraumpirat @gazebo_c
  @SoCraTes_Conf @teamcoder_ Yes, agree. I am pretty confident that we won't be
  near normal by January. I don't want encourage friends to take risks for this
  event. I'd like everyone to stay safe, so I don't think anyone expects
  @codefreeze_fi to happen in 2021.
