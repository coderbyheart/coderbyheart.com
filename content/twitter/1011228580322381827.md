  @NicoleRauch This is close to something I have been building recently: the
  core domain logic needs to run entirely in memory so you are not arguing about
  "storage" and can focus on correctness/behavior. I can see how I can use your
  work to extend that approach. 

  Will tell more @SoCraTes_Conf!

[@NicoleRauch](https://twitter.com/NicoleRauch) This is close to something I
have been building recently: the core domain logic needs to run entirely in
memory so you are not arguing about "storage" and can focus on
correctness/behavior. I can see how I can use your work to extend that approach.
Will tell more [@SoCraTes_Conf](https://twitter.com/SoCraTes_Conf)!
