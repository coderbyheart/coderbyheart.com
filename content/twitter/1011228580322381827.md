  @NicoleRauch This is close to something I have been building recently: the
  core domain logic needs to run entirely in memory so you are not arguing about
  "storage" and can focus on correctness/behavior. I can see how I can use your
  work to extend that approach. 

  Will tell more @SoCraTes_Conf!
