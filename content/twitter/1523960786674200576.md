  @NightWhistler @nikazawila @EmmaBostian There are no rules in that sense. The
  basis for lawsuits are typically laws regarding
  likestilling/Gleichstellung/anti-discrimination.  In Germany that's the
  Allgemeines

  Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (AGG), and employers want to avoid any wording that
  could be seen as discriminatory.
