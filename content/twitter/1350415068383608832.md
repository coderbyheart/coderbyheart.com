  I realized yesterday when talking to @wolframkriesing that ESM modules have an
  important use case: code-splitting in frontend applications. 


  Especially apps that deliver large bundles (&gt;2 MB) and/or update them very
  often (e.g. do trunk based development) will benefit. https://t.co/5eBkXWfSZ9
