  @RealIvanSanchez @NordicTweets I agree that the device should send the raw GPS
  data (which we do in newer examples like in the cat tracker firmware), and
  leave unnecessary computation to the cloud. I am pushing for this internally
  every day, but it's not easy to convince everyone why this is a bad idea.
