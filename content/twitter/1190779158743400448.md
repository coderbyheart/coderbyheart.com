  @gr2m @typescript Using TypeScript gets rid of an entire class of errors (how
  to properly call a function) and removes the need to test for proper arguments
  in the implementation of a function.

  This removes a lot of code I need to write (and maintain) because of JS beeing
  an untyped language.
