  @spazierendenken To be fair: I don't know any wiki that makes maintaining the
  validity of information easy. 


  It should be a built-in feature that the Wiki notifies authors on a
  per-paragraph section to confirm that the information in there is still valid,
  and also provide ways to archive them.
