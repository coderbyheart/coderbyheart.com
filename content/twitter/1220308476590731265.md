  @MartinaKraus11 @vicbergquist Hints for me they did not are:
  - simple fig leaf CoC
  - CfP does not encourage first-time speakers to apply
  - Compensation is up request, not universal
  - no activity on SoMe to encourage, find non-white-CIS-men whatsoever
  - no blog post detailing CfP process, support for speaker
