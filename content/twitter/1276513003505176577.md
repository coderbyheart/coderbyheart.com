  Test results with @twilio Super SIM and NB #IoT are: Super SIM connects and
  does TCP+UDP, but with NAT timeouts on the lower end of what we have measured
  so far. The NB IoT SIM did not connect, which is interesting because the
  @1NCE3 SIMs do work here.

  Regular SIM did not work. https://t.co/opAY6Sdwnl
