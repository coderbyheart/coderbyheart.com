  @gr2m @SemanticRelease @pvdlg_ That's great, I'll definitely give it a try.


  Could you consider using something else then *master*? @SemanticRelease could
  use this opportunity to set an example and not proliferate the use of this
  problematic term (it's also not correct). How about "latest", or "main"?
