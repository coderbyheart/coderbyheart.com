  @kmelve @even @sanity_io @contentful Thanks to this I moved the site over to
  https://t.co/KSzTwLjMvS, wasn't too hard since I knew how the config should
  look like.


  Maybe think about provide a TypeScript library to construct the config, that
  way it would be much easier to know which values are allowed...
