  @JillWohlner I do, because I believe it puts many in too much pressure. I use
  code-challenges that are very close to real tasks in our projects, and a
  technical assignment without a time-limit, so they can do it when it suits
  them best.

many in too much pressure. I use code-challenges that are very close to real
tasks in our projects, and a technical assignment without a time-limit, so they
can do it when it suits them best.
