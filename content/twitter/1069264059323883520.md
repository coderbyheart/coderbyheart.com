  @edimoraru @Paratron @SmartBear True, but it's also the possibilities of the
  tool that can limit the ways to collaborate. 

  Jira has a bias towards expressing everything in issues, issues can only be
  owned (assigned) to one person,... 

  These are decisions made by the tool, not by your process.
