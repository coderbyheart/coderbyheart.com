  My take is that IoT Core was axed in favor of other projects which deliver
  more short-term revenue (https://t.co/bBjRUS2Kr5). The growth potential for
  #IoT is huge, however we are still in a pretty early phase. It's a poor
  decision, a lot of customers want to run IoT on GCP. https://t.co/r6NCEEs47R
