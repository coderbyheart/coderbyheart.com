  @nelisboucke Having a buddy is great! We work with an independent consultant
  (paid hourly) who doesn't get kickbacks from insurance companies. However this
  (and buddy) is good for checking that all areas are covered, but having a good
  overview in one place, tracking is what I am researching.
