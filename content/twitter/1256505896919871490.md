  @TonyBologni Let's say you have a MS team working on 1 repo, with 5-6
  engineers, doing trunk-based-development easily can yield 100 commits per day.

  If you say that clear MS arch with boundaries don't need TBD I don't agree.
  Point is to limit need to sync on code that's not yet in trunk.

yield 100 commits per day. If you say that clear MS arch with boundaries don't
need TBD I don't agree. Point is to limit need to sync on code that's not yet in
