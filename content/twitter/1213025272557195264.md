  @chaos_monster @TonyBologni @intellijidea IME this is not happening very
  often, once you have tought developers about the global ignore list.


  Imagine what happens if a developer starts to use a new IDE: tens of
  PRs/changes which updates the .gitignore to accommodate their tool of choice
  on all projects they work on.
