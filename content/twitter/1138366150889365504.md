  @Tweet_Cassandra @mailbox_org Now for the secure part: I have some very
  privacy conscious friends and we all use @signalapp ... PGP is just too damn
  hard to set up, and even if you get it done, there have been bugs in clients
  which in the end mean that it's hard to trust that everything works correct.
