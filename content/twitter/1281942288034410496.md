  @unclebobmartin By stating that the police has never been the problem you use
  your platform to perpetuate the idea that the executions of many, many by
  police are somehow not their fault.

  This is a white supremacists idea, that it's not our fault, or the fault of
  the systems which we create. https://t.co/bOTME0ALDA
