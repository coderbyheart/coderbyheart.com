  Twitter for me is still the most important social network especially
  profesionally. I only actively use @coderbyheart these days. Still with the
  official client on mobile and @TweetDeck on Desktop. 


  Pro-tip: I have a private list with 170 members which I use as my home
  timeline. https://t.co/gcvRiPh177
