  I really wish @github actions had public environment variables, some things
  (e.g. AWS region identifiers) need to be configurable in actions, but do not
  need to be replaced with "***" in logs (and it makes it harder to debug).

I really wish [@github](https://twitter.com/github) actions had public
environment variables, some things (e.g. AWS region identifiers) need to be
configurable in actions, but do not need to be replaced with "\*\*\*" in logs
(and it makes it harder to debug).
