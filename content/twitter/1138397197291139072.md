  @lukehefson That's why I want a forced ranking of all issues, so that there is
  exactly 1 issue with the highest priority. 

  If you create a new issue and want to assign a priority the reported needs to
  pick which issues are less important, and which are more important.

[@lukehefson](https://twitter.com/lukehefson) That's why I want a forced ranking
of all issues, so that there is exactly 1 issue with the highest priority. If
you create a new issue and want to assign a priority the reported needs to pick
which issues are less important, and which are more important.
