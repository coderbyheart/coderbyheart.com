  @stanislav What C4 is missing for me is the "glue": in AWS architecture a lot
  is happening on the "arrows" between boxes and C4 does not focus on that; it
  puts an emphasis on components, however in cloud native archtitecture the
  containers are boring, the implementation is in the glue.

[@stanislav](https://twitter.com/stanislav) What C4 is missing for me is the
"glue": in AWS architecture a lot is happening on the "arrows" between boxes and
C4 does not focus on that; it puts an emphasis on components, however in cloud
native archtitecture the containers are boring, the implementation is in the
glue.
