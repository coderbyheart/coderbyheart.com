  @EmmaWedekind In order to get machines help us and make our lives better, we
  need to tell them what we need them to do.

  Unfortunately they do not speak our language so my job is to explain it to
  them.

  But I do not speak machine very good so often it is like talking to a dog. A
  very stupid dog.
