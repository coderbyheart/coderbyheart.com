  @sleepyfox @malk_zameth @marick @jessitron @ConfBuddy I also think we need to
  become better in including non-technical people. 


  Because too often agile/xp is implemented in IT without acknowledging that it
  can only work if the entire organization shifts towards removing hierarchies
  and enabling decisionmaking on all levels.
