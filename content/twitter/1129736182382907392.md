  @sleepyfox @malk_zameth @marick @jessitron I am trying to get more people to
  share their experience, especially by being more inclusive, through projects
  like @ConfBuddy and by being a session-buddy.


  I also would love to get back those who are beyond agile and have left the
  space to learn where they felt not heard.
