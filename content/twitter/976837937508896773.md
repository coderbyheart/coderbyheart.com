  Lets say you want to ensure that a dozen+ #JavaScript repositories follow the
  same conventions for 

  - settings in package.json (license, publishConfig, ..., scripts, deps)

  - .editorconfig

  - commitlint settings

  - tsconfig / tslint.json

  - README badges


  How would you automate that?
