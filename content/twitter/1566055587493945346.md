  @mgaertne @w3ltraumpirat @leiderleider @c089 The thing is that Master in
  German has the male gender (may not be correct but that's how it's often
  perceived). So using a germanized feminine version "Scrum Masterin" may sound
  wrong to you but some women want to use it to make it explicit to feel
  included.
