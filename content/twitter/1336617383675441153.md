  @SiarheiStulba @Maggysche @Mokhattab97 @EmmaBostian Your neutral stance here
  is ignoring the impact comments like this have on content creators. It
  diminishes the effort they put into creating something valuable for a
  professional audience and reduces it to an aesthetically pleasing performance
  for the audience.
