  @raae Since you can unfollow/follow multiple times, I'd model this using
  events

  unfollowed -&gt; followed

  followed -&gt; unfollowed

  and record these events.

  Your current list of followers (or at any given time in the past) is then an
  aggregation of these events until now (or given timestamp)
