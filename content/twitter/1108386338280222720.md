  @Idento_one @berntco Looking at https://t.co/TT81v1NN4T I do not see proof of
  the claims.

  The vehicle control demo is a nice gimmick, but a questionable real world
  scenario.

  That site only shows #blabla and in the video you can only observe ~1TPS. It's
  a closed system with two nodes. https://t.co/90xjHBZtLF
