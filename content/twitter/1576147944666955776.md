  @TomasSin4 Yes, sure, *in theory*. My point was that they build products not
  because there is clear demand today, but because they bet on the demand
  materializing once they show the robot to be a feasible option to replace
  existing solutions.

that they build products not because there is clear demand today, but because
they bet on the demand materializing once they show the robot to be a feasible
option to replace existing solutions.
