  @miskaknapek All feedback welcome! As stated in the repo, there is no
  scientific research yet about herd immunity, so *I* assume 80% first dose. Of
  course, eventually 1st shots will wear off.

  Also prediction is linear based on 7 day average, while vaccination ramps up
  faster now, but plateaus
