  @pati_gallardo The thing is, meetings have a fixed configuration of people,
  which creates a fixed ad-hoc hierarchy. For virtual meetings this never
  changes. Physical space provides multiple opportunities for reconfiguration,
  and therefore create more opportunities for everyone to speak up.

[@pati_gallardo](https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo) The thing is, meetings have
a fixed configuration of people, which creates a fixed ad-hoc hierarchy. For
virtual meetings this never changes. Physical space provides multiple
opportunities for reconfiguration, and therefore create more opportunities for
everyone to speak up.
