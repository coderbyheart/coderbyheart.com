  @der_workfloh Changes to the .gitignore are not free: they trigger CI runs,
  releases, reviews. Having people add their favourite rules creates noise. I
  don't want that.


  Having a huge catch-all .gitignore is no solution either, it will only cover
  known files. Additions trigger noise. &gt;
