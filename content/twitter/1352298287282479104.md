  I've developed a GitHub action which determines the *next* release version for
  the current repository using @semantic-release/commit-analyzer. This is useful
  in cases where you need to know the version to be released, so it can be
  included e.g. in a build. https://t.co/KIADUuo9Og https://t.co/gQLcpG0pJ4
