  @Niklas_L Always in close touch with customer / user base, and respect for
  them.

  Focus on quality.

  Code stewardship mentality.

  Good mixture of experience, always training juniors.

  Experienced people take responsibility in order to give freedom, room to less
  experienced.

  Keep promises.
