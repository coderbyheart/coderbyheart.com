  @rradczewski The reminder about needing to learn how to read and extend legacy
  React code is ðŸ’¯.


  But I do not agree with Classes being the predominant API interface  in
  libraries. I rarely see me using

    import Foo from 'X'
    new Foo()

  in projects.


  Browser-APIs are also class-free.
