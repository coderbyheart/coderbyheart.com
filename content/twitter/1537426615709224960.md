  My junior today asked for a recommendation how to document architecture. I
  don't have a good one, and I am again thinking about writing down how I want
  architecture to be documented: from the viewpoint of data that flows through
  it. It needs to be a dynamic, not arrows+boxes. https://t.co/gf1UuLbxPd
