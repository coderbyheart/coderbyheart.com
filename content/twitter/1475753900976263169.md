  @tdpauw @nagel_kl @fraclipe @jwgrenning From my experience it is less
  manageable, because lower level languages are harder maintain, and often are
  written with less abstractions, close to the metal, which impacts testability.
  Also executing code in virtual environments is harder. That doesn't mean TDD
  is not possible.
