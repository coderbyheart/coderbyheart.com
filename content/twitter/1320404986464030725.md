  @agroebbe I personally have anecdotal evidence from 20+ years of working as a
  software engineer that testing does provide clear benefits for the entire
  software lifecycle. 

  Which does not mean that different approaches wont deliver good software. I
  just haven't been part of such a project.

from 20+ years of working as a software engineer that testing does provide clear
benefits for the entire software lifecycle. Which does not mean that different
approaches wont deliver good software. I just haven't been part of such a
project.
