  @PatrickHeneise @greenkeeperio @snyksec Yes, true. Coming from  $399 / year to
  $9,588 is a 2400% price increase, just to get dependency updates.


  This will be a hard sell, but you could just look at how many PRs in your
  repos are labeled with #greenkeeper and calculate what it would cost to do
  this work manually.
