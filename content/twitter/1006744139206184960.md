  @mirjam_diala It can help to write down your thoughts: https://t.co/qrPZbEPLiU 


  The process of having written a thought will help you break a thought-cycle,
  which often happens. On paper it becomes clear, if we re-enter a cycle.


  That way you could identify if you have thought it through.
