  @FSevaistre It's ok to point out a controversial idea, but please consider
  your choice of words. Calling me a Nazi for my opinion on how to use software
  normalizes the term and puts me in line with literal Nazis who's goal is to
  kill people.

controversial idea, but please consider your choice of words. Calling me a Nazi
for my opinion on how to use software normalizes the term and puts me in line
