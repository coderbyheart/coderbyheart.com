  I'm really excited to be mentoring 4 teams (of 50) from @apcrams as part of a
  three months @code_door and @IBMSkillsBuild bootcamp that teaches students how
  software can be used to tackle important problems. They will be focusing on
  natural disasters. This is going to be amazing! https://t.co/0uUYircDXw
