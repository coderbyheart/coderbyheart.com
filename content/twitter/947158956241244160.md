  @datenreisender I share our CTO and CFOs observation, that engineers are great
  in identifiying risks and then oftentimes are too easily consumed by trying to
  prevent them as much as possible. Oftentimes the probability of the risk is
  highly overestimated and the total cost estimated falsely.
