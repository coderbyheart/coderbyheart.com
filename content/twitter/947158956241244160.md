  @datenreisender I share our CTO and CFOs observation, that engineers are great
  in identifiying risks and then oftentimes are too easily consumed by trying to
  prevent them as much as possible. Oftentimes the probability of the risk is
  highly overestimated and the total cost estimated falsely.

observation, that engineers are great in identifiying risks and then oftentimes
are too easily consumed by trying to prevent them as much as possible.
Oftentimes the probability of the risk is highly overestimated and the total
cost estimated falsely.
