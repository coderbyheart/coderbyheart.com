  VS @code LiveShare is nice, but is there a "follow me" function, so I can
  "call" the other person to my open file? 


  Also, for working with @typescript, shared hover popups would be awesome.

VS [@code](https://twitter.com/code) LiveShare is nice, but is there a "follow
me" function, so I can "call" the other person to my open file?

Also, for working with [@typescript](https://twitter.com/typescript), shared
hover popups would be awesome.
