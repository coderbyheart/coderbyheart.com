  @femtoduino @JacobusSystems Sure, but none of that is the case here.
  The challenge came after a 1,5 hour intro call.
  The coding challenge has no time limit, and they only spent a few hours on it.
  I've provided clear feedback within a day what is missing.
  They would have had the chance to correct it.
