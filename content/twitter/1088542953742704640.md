  @KimMaida @EuroTestingConf Preparing a talk improves the speakers skill to
  explain technical concepts, the public speaking itself improves their ability
  to defend their opinion in front of others. 

  This is a unique opportunity, which takes some time to prepare but is very
  rewarding in the end.
