  @nelisboucke I was working remotely for @dotHIV and it had been a few months
  working without meeting her. When I did then in real life I literally blurted
  out: "Wow, you are tall!". I felt really bad for saying that, afterwards. But,
  yeah, certain dimensions are totally not present remotely.

[@nelisboucke](https://twitter.com/nelisboucke) I was working remotely for
[@dotHIV](https://twitter.com/dotHIV) and it had been a few months working
without meeting her. When I did then in real life I literally blurted out: "Wow,
you are tall!". I felt really bad for saying that, afterwards. But, yeah,
certain dimensions are totally not present remotely.
