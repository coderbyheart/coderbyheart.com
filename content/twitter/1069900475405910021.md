  @EuroTestingConf I had more than one great #ETCmoment, so I blogged about all
  of them here: https://t.co/wIciLZoQYf


  Most important was that even being in the minority as a developer I felt very
  included and welcome. The atmosphere was always very friendly and never
  hostile or too opinionated.
