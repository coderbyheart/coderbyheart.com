  @Niklas_L I believe so, but "inefficiency" in my experience is in most cases
  "perceived inefficiency", and actually the fear of lack of control. Bigger
  organizations are impossible to fully grasp, so "processes" are introduced by
  managers to exert control in absence.

[@Niklas_L](https://twitter.com/Niklas_L) I believe so, but "inefficiency" in my
experience is in most cases "perceived inefficiency", and actually the fear of
lack of control. Bigger organizations are impossible to fully grasp, so
"processes" are introduced by managers to exert control in absence.
