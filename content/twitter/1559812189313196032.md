  It's time for a new wired headset with a microphone boom. I had mine for
  years, but it's beyond repair. I replaced the plug already, but it's generally
  deteriorating. I have the successor (Blackshark V2), but not soo happy (slight
  discomfort when wearing). What do you recommend? https://t.co/hrjpVWUdpr
