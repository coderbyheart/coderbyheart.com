  I think this is what a proper #serverless architecture diagram should look
  like:

  - focus on the scenario / feature (store and retrieve temperature from a
  device)

  - show the flow of data

  - show the services involved to enable flow

  - link to source code where they are defined. https://t.co/irvusVoFtE
