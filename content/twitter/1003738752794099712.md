  @_Tomalak I have been earning money writing PHP for 15 years. I will never
  forget that. 

  Impressive web applications are built using PHP (Wikipedia, Facebook, YouPorn,
  ...).

  It may be an ugly language, but it's a seriously valuable tool.

[@\_Tomalak](https://twitter.com/_Tomalak) I have been earning money writing PHP
for 15 years. I will never forget that. Impressive web applications are built
using PHP (Wikipedia, Facebook, YouPorn, ...). It may be an ugly language, but
it's a seriously valuable tool.
