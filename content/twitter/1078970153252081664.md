  @liran_tal @EuroTestingConf @goldbergyoni That comment made me add a slide!
  Although I focus on e2e tests in this talk I still have tons of unit tests.
  e2e tests will only cover the happy path and possible inputs are limited.

  Unit tests are super valuable, because they are fast and located close to the
  implementation.
