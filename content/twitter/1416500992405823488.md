  @Maaikees I fully agree the idea that developers are idle because they wait
  for good decisions to be made is so frightening, that they rather make bad
  decisions ... because you can fix them later in integration. Spoiler alert:
  you too, because by then the developers have already moved on.

[@Maaikees](https://twitter.com/Maaikees) I fully agree the idea that developers
are idle because they wait for good decisions to be made is so frightening, that
they rather make bad decisions ... because you can fix them later in
integration. Spoiler alert: you too, because by then the developers have already
moved on.
