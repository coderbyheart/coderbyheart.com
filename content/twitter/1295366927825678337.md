  @mxstbr @GatsbyJS Thank you for demonstrating that you and others are aware of
  what is wrong.

  It would be interesting to see what your questions and proposed actions are,
  but I can understand that it might be sensible to give leadership a while to
  prepare an answer before making those public.
