  @maaretp While I don't want to diminish the severity of attacking your legacy,
  I want to ensure that you have built a legacy of your own that stands for
  itself, without the (lack of) validation of any third party. That said, it is
  important to address efforts to minimize your works.

severity of attacking your legacy, I want to ensure that you have built a legacy
of your own that stands for itself, without the (lack of) validation of any
third party. That said, it is important to address efforts to minimize your
works.
