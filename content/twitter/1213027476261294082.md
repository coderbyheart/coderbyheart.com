  @YellowBrickC @lxztlr @TonyBologni Yes, you can solve it also with a well
  maintained .gitignore file that covers everything in all projects but this can
  get quite long.

  For me it adds noise if entries are in that file that have no use for the
  specific project, that is actually the reason why I want a "clean" file.
