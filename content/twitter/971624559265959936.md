  @cheeaun @davidpich @jesstelford @colloq_io Yes, it seems the brand building
  is more important than discoverability, or it's just too much of extra effort.


  Some idea was to create a syndication website (using https://t.co/SAdeUNvV3z
  markup) on IPFS (so it does not depend on a centralised service like lanyrd).
