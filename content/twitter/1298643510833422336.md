  @ChristosMatskas @Azure Yes, exactly. Basically all guides I see on Azure
  features stop when it comes to infrastructure as code. (PowerShell and CLI are
  not deterministic ways to set up infra).

  ARM is what I would love to see, because tools like Terraform&amp;Pulumi in
  the end compile ARM templates.
