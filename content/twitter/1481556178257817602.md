  @_francied I'd say I am 85% self-tought, but I think the hard part is knowing
  what to study. A university at least solves that for you through providing a
  curriculum. Especially when you are 18 and you don't know what's important.

[@\_francied](https://twitter.com/_francied) I'd say I am 85% self-tought, but I
think the hard part is knowing what to study. A university at least solves that
for you through providing a curriculum. Especially when you are 18 and you don't
know what's important.
