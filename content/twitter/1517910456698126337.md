  @_francied In general we are doing quite well, we hired around 200 people last
  year, which is roughly +20%. And most are engineers. I have some special
  challenges, which I think boil down to the missing track record my employer
  has for cloud solutions.

[@\_francied](https://twitter.com/_francied) In general we are doing quite well,
we hired around 200 people last year, which is roughly +20%. And most are
engineers. I have some special challenges, which I think boil down to the
missing track record my employer has for cloud solutions.
