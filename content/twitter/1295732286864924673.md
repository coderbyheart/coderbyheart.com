  @BLJENGINEERING @NordicTweets It's quite hard to brick them, really. I do
  flashing quite a lot and it never happened to me.

  Plug it into USB and check what's printed on the console.

  No lights often means it's stuck in a reboot loop because the flashing failed.
  Just reflashing the FW will solve this typically.

[@NordicTweets](https://twitter.com/NordicTweets) It's quite hard to brick them,
really. I do flashing quite a lot and it never happened to me. Plug it into USB
and check what's printed on the console. No lights often means it's stuck in a
reboot loop because the flashing failed. Just reflashing the FW will solve this
typically.
