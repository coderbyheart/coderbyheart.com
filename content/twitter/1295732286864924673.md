  @BLJENGINEERING @NordicTweets It's quite hard to brick them, really. I do
  flashing quite a lot and it never happened to me.

  Plug it into USB and check what's printed on the console.

  No lights often means it's stuck in a reboot loop because the flashing failed.
  Just reflashing the FW will solve this typically.
