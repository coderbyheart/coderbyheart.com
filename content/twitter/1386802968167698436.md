  @Niklas_L I find this very disappointing. Everything is political, and saying
  that it doesn't, and also concentrating power, enforcing hierarchies sounds
  like there is no guidance and clarity in the organization. If they struggle
  with focus, I'd put effort on improving that.

Everything is political, and saying that it doesn't, and also concentrating
power, enforcing hierarchies sounds like there is no guidance and clarity in the
