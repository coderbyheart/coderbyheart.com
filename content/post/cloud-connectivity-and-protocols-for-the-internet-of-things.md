This is a webinar I did for
[Nordic Semiconductor Tech Webinars](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Events/Webinars)
together with my colleague Carl Richard Fosse, but it applies to everyone who
wants to get an introduction to protocols to consider when developing a cellular
IoT product.

It provides an overview over the important factors that need to be considered
when it comes to picking the right solution for sending your products' data to
the cloud.
