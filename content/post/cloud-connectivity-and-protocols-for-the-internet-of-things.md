This is a webinar I did for [Nordic Semiconductor](https://nordicsemi.com) but
it applies to everyone who wants to get an introduction to protocols to consider
when developing a cellular IoT product.

It provides an overview over the important factors that need to be considered
when it comes to picking the right solution for sending your products' data to
the cloud.
