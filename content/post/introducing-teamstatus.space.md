I am happy to announce a side-project that Iâ€™ve been working on for a while, and
which I have been using daily since its inception.

Use teamstatus.space to track what you are working on, as it happens. It may be
small updates, or big releases.

Status updates are associated with projects, which belong to organizations.

You can invite coworkers to the projects you are working on. They then can also
add their own status to the project.

Team members can see status, and add reactions. They are an important tool to
share praise ðŸŒŸ, but also prepare the next sync meeting. Status can be marked as
significant ðŸš€, so they will be highlighted in the next sync. Or a status can be
marked as a question ðŸ™‹ so they can be discussed during the sync.

And when it's time for a sync meeting with your collaborators, you create a new
sync which collects all the status updates from the projects your meeting is
about, from all the collaborators and a time frame you can specify.

This way you do not have to remember all the big and small things that happened
since your last sync with this team; or the other group of stakeholders you only
meet every other week.

And since you can share what happened in advance, you can spend your time during
the meeting to discuss the highlights and the open question which
[ensures that everyone's time is used most efficiently](/speed-up-your-meetings-with-pre-written-meeting-minutes).

This project is in an early stage and I am interested to hear your feedback,
especially whether this is a tool you would use yourself. As a thank you for
your input youâ€™ll be able to keep using the tool without charge with all paid
features, if and when this turns into a paid service.

Iâ€™ve created a self-guided onboarding flow which will guide you through the
features, so just head over to <https://teamstatus.space> to sign up. Iâ€™m happy
to receive your feedback on a channel that you prefer, but I want to dog-food
it, so please use the `$teamstatus#feedback` project for your feedback.
