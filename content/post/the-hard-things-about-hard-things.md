[The Hard Things About Hard Things][1] by [Ben Horowitz][2] is a book for CEOs.
Horowitz explains in a very easy to read and an entertaining style his learnings
as a CEO. For me it was especially helpful to better understand the role of a
CEO and exciting the get a look into to the decision strategies of a battle-
proven startup founder.

Especially useful for non-CEOs like me and and from a leadership perspective are
his remarks on the importance of the CEO being the person in an organization
that is actually in the position to make tough decisions and that finding
decisions in a commitee does not yield the best decision in the interest of the
company. In combination with his chapter on the _Peacetime/Wartime CEO_ this
helps to understand the role of a CEO: companies cant function properly without
them and they are in a constant state of struggle, often dilemma. The _hard
thing_ is that there is no simple answer to this and they deservere respect and
forgiveness for their sometimes hard to understand decisions. But only the
unique position of a CEO who has all knowledge about a business enables thme to
weigh that information and find the best decision-or just the least bad one.

Where Horowitz stands out for me is the fact that he goes great length into
explaining the importance of not letting _politics_ destroy the connection and
trust employees have in their company. He values the individual learning and
development over everything else because in the end it will be the strength of
the team that carries a startup through tough times.

The book is a short read and I highly recommend it to (future) entrepreneurs and
team leads.
