It has been a year since I started to work for
[Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com/) in Trondheim, and
[expat Mid-Norway](https://www.expatmidnorway.no/) has been part of my journey
here right from the beginning. When Nordic Semiconductor flew me to Trondheim
for the in-person interview, I met with Ellen for the first time. I remember
vividly how she answered all the questions I had regarding immigrating to Norway
and gave me the confidence that there would be someone which would take care of
all the important and annoying tasks. This was an important factor why I finally
decided to take the job offer. And it turned out to be absolutely true. Ellen
and her team were meticulously planning the immigration, the move, helped with
finding a very nice flat according to our wishes and made sure that moving to
Norway was a smooth experience so that we could settle as fast as possible. At
no time did I encounter surprises. It was the first immigration for us and I
would do it again with Ellen and her team—even if I had to pay for it on my own,
the money is very well spent. Because now in her 10th year, Ellen knows that
logistics are just one part of what is needed to make a move to a foreign
country a success.

What I especially enjoy is the continued support expat Mid-Norway offers after
the move: information meetings on healthcare, taxes and pension on the one hand
and the Norwegian language course and conversation group offer very valuable
support to integrate better into the Norwegian society. There are also more
information occasions every week, like hiking trips, board game nights, fishing
excursions, knitting, which provide a great opportunity to get to know many of
the other expats in Trondheim - you are part of a network from day one, which is
very important since you are leaving your old network behind. With this support
you are not feeling “alone” in Trondheim and you can also more easily get to
know people outside of your workplace.

I am now also on the other side of this experience: since I am hiring for Nordic
Semiconductor it gives me great confidence to have expat Mid-Norway as part of
our offering. I know that we are not only offering a job in a world class team
of engineers, but our support for relocating new employees and their families to
Trondheim has the same standard: world class and with the fanatical commitment
to make a relocation a lasting success.
