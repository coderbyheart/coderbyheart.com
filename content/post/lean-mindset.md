[Lean Mindset][book] by Mary and Tom Poppendieck is only 160 pages long, but it
packs a punch: companies that follow the agile way of building software driven
by customer needs will eventually deliver a good result. But good does not mean
exciting nor innovative. Just good does not set you apart from any other
software company out there and makes you replaceable as a service provider.

In their book Mary and Tom take the reader on a quest that eventually leads to
finding the answer for the most powerful question: how can organizations create
breakthrough innovations in a predictable (or at least sustainable) way?

Chapter by chapter they lay out their understanding of the fundamentals that are
needed to build software that truly serves the customer, and they don't all
short on highlighting what's needed to achieve that: engaged employees with a
deep understanding of the underlying business rules, a clear purpose and vision
for the product they are building. Every section is supported by a real-world
case study so you don't have to take their word for granted, but can see the
respective theories in action in real life.

This book easily made it to the top of my reading recommendation for managers,
founders, and developers as well. Keep a copy of the book handy, so you can
check once in a while their _questions to ponder_ provided after every chapter.
