Since I just was interviewed about this topic, I'll try to write down some of my
recommendations on how to build a professional network if you are early in your
career and how to progress from there. Actually I am practicing all of these
actions even today.

I'll focus on building a network to other professionals in your industry, since
this will enable you to learn about new technologies, improve you skills based
on experiences they are sharing and ask for support, find mentors and later on
jobs and hires.

In my experience the tech scene is especially good approachable on **Twitter**.
I find myself [following a lot developers](https://twitter.com/following) there
and this way I get daily access to what is going on tech-wise. The real-time
character of the network has it's advantages: you can easily interact on a given
topic but it rarely happens that someone resurrects a old post. It's very easy
to approach someone with a question there, and they usually will answer right
away.

But make now mistake, _following_ someone on Twitter is a one-way street, to
build a network you have to **share something** so people can become aware of
you. And since connections are built on trust, it means you have to expose
yourself to some degree. And this exposure needs to happen in the physical
world, only there will you be able to build connections that support exchange
about personal and confidential matters which is the basis for finding good
advisors and mentors.

The first step is to go to local meetups. Do not fear to go there as a
_beginner_, the first step to learning something is to embrace the unknown. It's
a great opportunity to learn to know new people and find out who you would be
interested to talk to. You will find that approaching someone there is a lot
easier compared to a contacting them only e.g. through LinkedIn. Since you are
both part of the same interest group, and you took the time to be present at the
meetup will give you already some credibility. Also, it's harder to turn down
someone who is approaching you face to face.

Early in your career you should develop the confidence to **give your first
talk**. Watch other speakers and try to find someone with experience as a
speaker to give you feedback on your talk. Most meetups will be happy to host a
beginner talk,
[since they always provide really valuable input](https://coderbyheart.com/bring-your-inexperience-to-a-conference/).
Giving talks will put you in the spotlight—doing it at a small meetup where you
know people can be even more uncomfortable compared to a huge conference—but it
also gives you a lot of visibility. I can highly recommend
[the software crafter communities](https://softwarecrafters.org/) around the
world as a very inclusive and beginner-friendly community of professionals.

Every talk creates the opportunity to reuse the content in multiple ways. You
can use it to share your findings on your blog, but even better: submit it to a
conference.

The next step of building a valuable network is to **attend conferences**. At
conferences you will be able connect with a great variety of people. Those that
share the same problems as you do and other beginners which will be a great
resource when learning a new topic since you can exchange about your findings
and problems. Since last year, it became common to connect through a Slack
instance for that conference. Here you can also easily approach speakers, with
your questions or on general to just give them feedback on their talk. In both
case they will usually be very open and happy to help you. It's a good idea to
check out a conference schedule beforehand and follow the speakers on Twitter,
doing that you can start building a connection to them even before the event.

You should **submit your beginner talk** to conferences, because giving a talk
will teach you so many great things that improve your skills on many levels. You
can find conferences that accept proposals (Call for Papers, or _CfP_ for short)
on [papercall.io](https://www.papercall.io/events) or through
[lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/). Karolina has a great post on
[How to write a successful conference proposal](https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32).
Becoming a speaker on a conference will give you a lot of visibility and
provides a great opportunity to meet other industry experts on eye-level.
