[Twist](https://twistapp.com/) is the Doist team's answer to the overwhelming
amount of real-time interaction
[they have experienced](https://blog.doist.com/why-were-betting-against-real-time-team-messaging-521804a3da09)
using Slack:

> It wasn’t healthy for our team, and it wasn’t helping us focus on the hard
> work that really moves projects forward.

Ironically, instead of changing their habits, which are the root cause for their
issues, they set out to solve the problem by building a new tool, essentially a
forum, with stricter rules applied to how communication _should_ work.

Every powerful tool, like Slack, comes with the responsibility to _learn_ how to
use it properly. And if you do, it's general purpose makes it so easily
adaptable for many use cases. It's the same with Trello where boards can become
very chaotic and overwhelming for users that don't know how which features are
there to organize cards.

Not matter _which tool_ you use to communicate, one of the most important
actions to tackle _communication chaos_ is **defining a communication policy**.
([You can read about the rules at one of my former workplaces here.](https://coderbyheart.com/working-remote-fix-the-missing-watercooler/#protip2defineacommunicationescalationprocess))
This means that you establish a common, (written!), understanding within your
team, which communication tool you use for what and what the expected response
times are.

Especially for a highly invasive tool like Slack rules like these can help:

- we don't expect to answer to Slack messages immediately, but within 4 hours on
  a work day
- we use the Do Not Disturb feature to signal if we need uninterrupted time to
  work
- we don't send Slack messages an Weekends or Holidays
- we rarely ever use `@channel` in general topic channels
- we switch to Video Chat if we observe that a ping-pong discussion is happening

It's also important to educate every team member about the features of each tool
to manage notifications, and how to turn them off.

So the next time when you start blaming a tool for limiting your ability to be
productive, try taking a step back and find the root cause for the symptom.
