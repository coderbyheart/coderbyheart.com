When dealing with structured data there are no tools for collaboration

## Blog posts are the gravestones of ideas

What I am doing right now is the wrong approach — but as I am going to show you
later I have no other means right now. Let’s say I’d like to map out the start
up hot spots in my area. I could write up a blog post with _'The 10 hottest
places for start ups in the area'_. This blog post would be valid for a few
weeks, maybe half a year. But it will rot, its _data_ will get outdated sooner
or later. I’d have to constantly visit and update it. But as it is with people
engaged in communities it is with specific knowledge: it will shift to another
person who rises as a new expert. And they will write up _another_ blog post.

## But what if they could collaborate on mine?

They can. Send me an email. Tweet me a link to a new location. I can create an
account for them on my blogging platform — if it offers that feature.

The task of collaboration on piece of text isn’t as simple as it sounds. If you
are in the business of asking someone for help you better make it as easy as it
gets to collaborate with you.

And there the trouble starts.

## We need atomic collaboration

Picture this:  
You can go to my imagined posting about the 10 hot spots and just click on _'Add
a hotspot'_, provide the details of I location I missed and click send. I’d get
a notification email with a preview of your addition and can accept it with one
click. I can do that even without knowing who you are, as the _data_ you provide
speaks for itself.

This is what I call _atomic collaboration_. Atomic in the means of actions
required to collaborate. They should be small. Really small.

## We need structured data

You have to trust me on this: there is basically no usable way to track the
changes to piece of text. If I want atomic collaboration I need structured data.
I can split a text into it’s parts — headlines, paragraphs, lists,
etc. — editing gets _a lot_ more manageable.

## We need open data

There is one last thing: collaboration on data also requires you to let go in
terms of ownership of the content. There is no better invitation to collaborate
on content then to make it public domain. The open source movement has shown the
way: everyone can collaborate and if there are differences they are either
settled or a fork is made — there never is _the one_ solution.

## Atomic collaboration on open structured data = ?

I think we all could use a _github for data_. A platform that is neutral in
terms of the content it manages but makes clear decisions on how the
collaboration is done.

I’ll keep on looking!

I did [a followup](./just-edit-it) a few weeks later where I explained a little,
what I think when talking about the _Github for data_.
