---

Last year was the first time for me attending
[BoosterConf](https://boosterconf.no/) and I was happy to re-visit it again this
year.

Around 400 participants gather in one of Norway's most beautiful cities:
[Bergen](https://en.visitbergen.com/). During three conference days, the
BoosterConf program offers keynotes, lightning talks, experience reports,
workshops and even an OpenSpace during one afternoon. The program is very
varied, and offers content and inspiration for the entire team. That is also the
reason why the audience was a good mixture of all roles involved in digital
projects.

The agenda offers a nice pacing and long enough breaks so there is time to
connect with other attendees and reflect on what was just heard.

I really liked the opportunity to discuss relevant topics with participants
during the open space, which this year was 3 hours long without any program at
the side, so there was no distraction. I wished the OpenSpace was however split
in multiple rooms and not run as multiple chair circle in the big hall.

The conference has already published the video recordings on
[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/boosterconf), so you can get yourself an impression of
the talks. However, the workshops and the OpenSpace was not recorded.

Lisi has also written about her impressions on her blog:
[Lisi Hocke: Booster Conference 2023 - Changing Perspectives](https://www.lisihocke.com/2023/04/booster-conference-2023-changing-perspectives.html).

Here are the sessions that I attended; I shared them live on Mastodon using the
hashtag [#BoosterConf](https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/tagged/BoosterConf).

## Day 1

### Opening keynote

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110105403371093294/embed>

The #BoosterConf opening keynote is by
[Anne Landro](https://no.linkedin.com/in/annelandro), a Norwegian service
designer, and she talks about how to build innovative solutions that people
really want (however they won't honestly tell you).

She gave us a quick assignment: talk to each other 2 minutes about a specific
time when you were showering.

Very interesting to see how few managed very essential things like: were you wet
when you left the shower, were you dry when you entered?

That shows that users, when interviewing them, can't share many important facts.

Users are too used to the (suboptimal) processes that they are using, they can't
see the problems with it.

In order to find good solutions we need to dig deep into the problem and resist
the urge to jump to the immediate, obvious solution.

But just talking is not enough, and getting to the true needs of a user is
challenging, because users are often not honest about their true needs.

[ I love the 5 Why's for that: <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys> ...
and she just mentioned it. ]

There is a less offensive way to dig into the root cause (5 Why's can feel
offensive), you can ask users about the benefits they solution they have in mind
will yield for them. This can lead onto the path of finding out why they have a
specific solution in mind.

Nevertheless, the best way to find out what your users need is to observe them
find the user's pain points.

But make sure that does not influence them too much. Because users that are
aware that they are watched, often behave differently.

### Lightning talks

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110105689011221411/embed>

First set of lightning talks at #BoosterConf starts with
[Einar W. H√∏st](https://chaos.social/@einarwh@mastodon.social) who reminds us
that developers should be emancipated enough to understand their role with the
same confidence as the so called business people do. They are, in the end, the
ones who need to take ownership over the decisions they make and how they
influence the business.

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110105729764807207/embed>

The second talk is by
[Daria Kostiuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daria-kostiuk-23944b64) who speaks
about the dangers of scope creep.

Don't forget that any new feature you accept has a tendency to cause unintended
side-effects and cause other things to take longer than expected.

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110105773885756845/embed>

The third talk is by [Kjersti Berg](https://ohai.social/@kjerstibb), who talks
about reviving a code base from a state where it was practically unmaintainable.

She used an ensemble approach to get out of this mess. They used one hour every
day to get everyone together. Ensembling helps here because it improves
knowledge sharing and decision making; both are key to make confident decision.

After a year this improved code quality, ability to fix bugs and overall team
happiness!

Finally in this slot of Lightning Talks at #BoosterConf
[Dalibor Jovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakipro) has also a talk about
technical debt and he proposes a few things you can do about it (because
sometimes it is not avoidable).

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110105991859742366/embed>

Now in the second slot of Lightning Talks at #BoosterConf
[Nora Gj√∏en-Gj√∏s√¶ter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanteganora) gives us a very
important reminder how biased AI models are.

They all are, but some are more than others and effort is needed to not
reinforce and proliferate the biases the models get from their source data.

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110106029163172924/embed>

[Karianne Berg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kberg) shares her best practices for
making awesome database indexes. Some strong language included ü§£.

Make sure to understand your database schemas when building your applications,
otherwise your performance will suck!

Monitor in production to spot queries that need to be optimized (often the
problem only becomes apparent with production data).

Very cool lightning talk by [Embla Flatlandsmo](https://emblaflatlandsmo.com/)
explaining how keyboards just‚Ñ¢Ô∏è work when you plug them into your computer. Love
the hand-drawn slides!

### Architecture Workshop with Oliver Zeigermann

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110106420255302087/embed>

we are working on a car insurance architecture Kata. First we are looking at a
very simplistic implementation.

Then we are reviewing potential solutions by trying a few simple examples on
<https://ml-playground.com/> which is a really great idea to explain
architectural tradeoffs.

Finally, we got 30 minutes to discuss potential solutions in teams. That was
fun!

### Fishbowl

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110105827972761842/embed>

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110106940802730380/embed>

Now it's time for the fishbowl at #BoosterConf with controversial questions from
the audience:

- Is HTML a programming language? Doesn't matter.
- Uncertainty is mandatory: yes
- Should we fear AI? No, potential is real.
- There is no such thing as a full-stack developer: right, there is not.
- There is nothing every developer must know: probably Git today is a common
  denominator. But for every given profession there is a set of tools you need
  to know.
- Technology should not be seen as magic.
- Psychological safety is just a lazy excuse for doing nothing: absolutely not.
  There is research that shows that high performance and psychological safety
  correlates.
- Cloud vendor independence is not needed and wasteful: maybe, but some
  standardization is useful.

## Day 2

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110111000689327084/embed>

Second day of #BoosterConf starts with a #refactoring workshop run by Karoline
Skylstad and
[Siv Midtun Rollup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siv-midtun-hollup-b263611), we
are going to dive into a #Java codebase while applying some constraints.

The project source we work with is <https://github.com/kantega/refaktorama>.

### OpenSpace

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110112027695532354/embed>

Really cool to have two slots for #OpenSpace sessions at #BoosterConf.

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110112058673684939/embed>

The topics.

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110112137524008976/embed>

First round: talking about quality.

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110112642743962719/embed>

Second round at the #BoosterConf #OpenSpace: why do do many companies require CS
degrees?

This is where I learned about
https://www.vilbli.no/nb/nb/no/informasjonsteknologi-og-medieproduksjon/program/v.im
which teaches media and programming skills which allows workers to enter the
workforce much earlier with relevant skills. It's still a certified training, so
companies get a reliable level of education.

### Talk by Elisabeth Whiteley about side-projects

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110112691160134601/embed>

[Elisabeth Whiteley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisabeth-whiteley-565a3463)
shares great insights on how she deals with finding a way for side projects so
it doesn't feel like work.

Make it fun, and don't replicate the same constraints that you have for work!

## Day 3

### Talk by Hege Dreiem about API Design

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110116700672549731/embed>

Final day of #BoosterConf and I am starting with a session on API Design from
[Hege Dreiem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hege-dreiem-0186982).

She talks about the challenges of designing a ticket booking API for the
Norwegian railway.

It's important to design an API that gets used by many clients that you don't
control to be open for extensions from the start.

Developing a ubiquitous language is important in the beginning to develop an
understanding of what the API needs to express.

### Talk by Aleksander Olavsrud about Machine Learning

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110116753113476303/embed>

[Marius Aleksander Olavsrud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marius-aleksander-olavsrud-812a4617a)
explains how he and his team used Machine Learning to reduce the number of
wasted breads at a Norwegian supermarket chain.

Building a ML solution that works requires the right data. However that often is
not there. Make sure to get the input data right. The implementation is only
half of the project. Don't underestimate the effort needed to change their
processes according to the findings.

They used Facebook Prophet because it can account very good for seasonal and
holiday events (and it's open source).

Unfortunately he did not share how successful this project was in the end.

### Talk about GraphQL by P√•l Thomassen

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110117215000547075/embed>

[P√•l Thomassen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/p%C3%A5l-thomassen-03354212) now
shares his bad experience with GraphQL for building an API for traffic data at
Statens Vegvesen.

He starts with a basic introduction to #GraphQL. The bug advantage he mentions
is that it is great to document the contract between server and clients, and
there are many tools that can generate consumer code.

The goal was to provide public access to the data they collect, and in 2018 when
they need to pick a new technology it looked like a good choice, addressing the
shortcomings of REST. The initial evaluation and internal tests went quite well,
and even though there was some hesitation because it was uncertain if it was the
right choice over REST, it was decided to continue with the approach. It was
easy to model the API according to the business domain. And they went on to
launch it.

Now for the downsides:

- it introduces a bunch of new and complex concepts for implementing it properly
- from a client point of view it can be challenging to build clients that need
  to retrieve a lot of deep, nested data
- Many users often want spreadsheet exports, that's hard to match from a nested
  structure
- Because of the complexity the internal adoption of the new API was not a full
  success, which is a good indication that it's not an optimal solution
- a lot of consumers wanted access to Gigabytes of data, and transferring this
  via #GraphQL creates a huge overhead.

So it turned out that it a traditional REST API would have been a better choice,
both it would be easier to maintain with a smaller team, and it's a more
established technology that would scale better for this specific project.

### Talk by Andrew Harmel-Law about Architecture

<https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart/110117723882154948/embed>

In his session at #BoosterConf
[Andrew Harmel-Law](https://chaos.social/@ahl@twit.social) talks about how
architects can change their behaviour to not keep teams back, but to enable them
making their own architecture decisions. #AnybodyArchitecture

He proposes The Advice Process:

"Anyone can make any decision But before doing so they must: seek advice from
all affected parties & people with expertise in the matter."

But how to keep people from making bad decisions? Use ADRs to document the
decision to be made and iterate on it.

In the draft phase the team pulls in advice from all affected parties and
document this advice.

All of this effort gets synchronized in weekly meetings of the Architectural
Advice Forum.

It's important to track progress of ADRs to have an eye on those ADRs that get
stuck.

Finally he points out to watch out for potential causes this approach can fail:

1. "Bad" decisions (there are none really)
2. Old guard == New guard (not giving room for others to make decisions)
3. Off-the-grid decisions (teams not using the process)
4. No trust

This is the detailed blog post for this talk:
