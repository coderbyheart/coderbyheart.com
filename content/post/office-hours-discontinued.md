In January 2015 [I offered CTO office hours](./office-hours) every other
Thursday. This came out of a new years resolution to do more things that I
really enjoy–and I enjoy meeting people and work with them and their ideas.

That decision had a fascinating side-effect. When one of my former co-eds asked
me to be her mentor the answer was a no-brainer: of course, I can and want to do
that! I don't know how that call would have turned out if I didn't have thought
about the office hours in January.

As a fallout from [my search for a new job](./leaving-dothiv) I also offered to
be a mentor for the founder of a local startup. We are new meeting every two
weeks for two hours.

What I enjoy about being a mentor over giving office hours is that continuously
supporting a person enables me to see the effects of my mentoring first hand
which also teaches me a lot in return. That's the kind of win-win situation I am
always looking for and I've experienced in the last three years so often: give
unconditionally and with pleasure and you'll get even more in return.

Nevertheless, I'm not totally bailing out on the office hours.  
Just [write me an email][1] and I'll try to help you.
