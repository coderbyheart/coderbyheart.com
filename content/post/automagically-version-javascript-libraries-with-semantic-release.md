We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
to automatically determine the next version of a library **and** release it to
our npm organization.

The next version is determined by scanning the commit messages. They must follow
[the Angular commit message rules](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format),
and in every library [a hook](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint) will
check commit messages against these rules.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The `package.json` of a project should only contain `0.0.0-development` as
> the `version` property, semantic-release will ignore the value.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only the published package on npm will contain the correct version number.

## How to release a new version of a package

Let's assume we have a library, which has the npm version `2.3.4`.

A new version will be publish by the respective project's CI run. All you have
to do is to use commit messages that follow the
[schema describe here](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format).

There are three commit messages that will trigger a release:

**Patch release:**

    fix: <commit message>

**Feature release:**

    feat: <commit message>

**Breaking Release:**

    <scope>: <commit message>

    BREAKING CHANGE:

    <description of breaking change>

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that **any other** commit message format **will not trigger** a release.

### Patch release üêû (`fix`) `2.3.4 -> 2.3.5`

üëâ A fix is a change to the implementation which removes a bug **without
changing the public API** (method names and signatures, exports) of the library.
The consumer of the library must not need to change their implementation when
installing the fixed version.

To release a fix (which will update the version from `2.3.4` to `2.3.5`, use the
type `fix` in the commit message:

    fix: <commit message>

You can optionally add a scope, which is a lowercase string used to identify the
affected _component_.

    fix(<scope>): <commit message>

Scopes are useful when the project is rather big.

### Feature release üöÄ (`feat`) `2.3.4 -> 2.4.0`

üëâ A feature is a change to the implementation of a library which adds
additional functionality **without changing the public API** of the library. You
may add new exports, methods and even extra, optional method arguments, but the
consumer of the library must not need to change their implementation when
installing the library with the new feature.

![Yeah](https://media.giphy.com/media/9G6FaVKbEUWrK/giphy.gif)

To release a feature (which will update the version from `2.3.4` to `2.4.0`, use
the type `feat` in the commit message:

    feat: <commit message>

You can optionally add a scope as well.

### Breaking Release üö® (`BREAKING CHANGE:`) `2.3.4 -> 3.0.0`

üëâ Every time the public API of the library changes in a way that requires the
consumer to update their implementation **you must mark the change as
breaking**. This can happen if method names and arguments are renamed,
previously optional arguments become required, arguments get removed, classes
get renamed. Even if the change is very small, as soon as you are breaking the
library's _contract_ (it's public API) it is considered a breaking change,
[according to semver](https://semver.org/#spec-item-8).

![Boom](https://media.giphy.com/media/aEI2mYEPQ4A2Q/giphy.gif)

To release a breaking release (which will update the version from `2.3.4` to
`3.0.0`, use the text `BREAKING CHANGE:` (followed by a space of two new-lines)
in the commit message:

    refactor: <commit message>

    BREAKING CHANGE:

    <description of breaking change>

You can optionally add a scope as well.

Not that in the case of a breaking release the message type (here `refactor`)
can be any valid type.

## Typical changes

### Updated dependencies

If you are manually updating dependencies in a library, you should commit the
change as a fix, so that consumers are also using the updated dependencies.

### Refactoring

If you do a pure refactoring of a library without changing the features and the
public API **but** want to use the refactored version in your consumers, commit
the refactoring as a feature. After all, you are improving the library which
qualifies as a feature, e.g. it could be a performance-improvement.

## How releases are published

After you have pushed your changes to the remote repository, a job will be run
on the CI runner. If the job completes successfully (e.g. if all tests pass and
the linter does not report any errors), `semantic-release` will determine the
next version to be released.

The _"highest"_ commit will _win_ (`fix` > `feat` > `breaking change`). This
means if the list of commit messages since the last release contains _only_
fixes, the patch version will be incremented (`2.3.4 -> 2.3.5`). If the list of
commits contains at least one new feature, then the minor version will be
incremented and the patch version will be set to `0` (`2.3.4 -> 2.4.0`). If the
list of commits contains at least one breaking change, then the major version
will be incremented and the minor and patch versions will be set to `0`
(`2.3.4 -> 3.0.0`).

This new version will be written to the `package.json` and the package will be
[published to the npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish).

## Happy releasing!
