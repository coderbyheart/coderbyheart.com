_I recently proposed to establish a Code of Conduct for the
[BarCamp RheinMain](https://barcamp-rheinmain.de/). Here is my rationale why._

tl;dr: _Your every word_ influences other humans. I believe it is worth
scrutinizing your own behaviour.

Germany is a society dominated by [CIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender)
white males. Who doesn't acknowledge this as a deficit _is part of the problem_.
Acknowledgement is the first step if we want to change the status quo. A Code of
Conduct [like this one](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html) with a very stark
focus on sexual harrassment puts a spotlight on the fact that it is actually a
huge problem how our society treats humans that do not identify with the simple
black and white idea of man / woman = strong / weak.

Behaviour is always influenced by experiences, only if we change the environment
in which we interact with other and challenge the way how we do so, change can
be achieved. In my opinion it is our duty as event organizers to take on this
task.

Given that we welcome many young participants at our BarCamps we have the chance
to support them in the development of their personality in a good way or at
least to not harm them.
