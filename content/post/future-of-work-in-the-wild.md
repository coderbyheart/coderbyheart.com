_\#futureofwork_ is a rather abstract term which stands for changing our
workplaces from a concept that was conceived in the 19th century to something
that reflects the needs of the 21st century humanâ€“at least for those of us who
are asked to _produce_ creatively and innovatively.

There are **a lot** of theoretical resources detailing what needs to be done to
create an environment in which knowledge-workers can achieve their best possible
output.

But there are organizations which have already arrived at _the future of work_.

At the next agile round table, which will take place on April 2nd 2015 at
[Die Zentrale FFM Coworking Space](http://www.die-zentrale-ffm.de/), I'll be
giving a lightning talk to show some examples of these organizations.
