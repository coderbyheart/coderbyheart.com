Here is something for you #agile practitioners to do in 2018:

**Can we have space for people whose energy is drained by all the interaction
that is promoted in all agile methods?**

In case you haven't noticed: everything focuses on human interaction and all
material focuses on how to "design" human interaction so that it yields results.

What I don't see in books, articles, vides is a strong reminder that many will
have their energy drained by constant interaction.

Of course, there is an implicit _space_ between activities which some people
will actively use to retract and recharge.

But not everybody can muster the courage to actively do so, if the environment
we as agile coaches and trainers are presenting the ideal does not mention
"alone-time"; they will see their need to have solitude as something
unfavorable.

It is not!

Please mention this in your training material, books and videos.
