I use the (developer) happiness questionnaire to collect honest feedback about
the happiness of my colleagues. It is based on the book
[First break all the rules](http://amzn.to/1JYiGoB) by the Gallup Institute but
has been slightly modified.

[Gallup tested thousands of questions](https://q12.gallup.com/help/en-us/Answers/164468)
on millions of employees to find the right questions with the exact wording that
provided the highest correlation to business results most companies regularly
measure — profitability, productivity, turnover, and safety.

My modified version alters the phrasing of question 9, which originally reads

> Are my associates or fellow employees committed to doing quality work.

This is split into two questions:

> Are all colleagues working with all their possibilites for the company's
> goal?  
> Is it favored to deliver high-quality work results?

This enables to distinguish between individual commitment to qualitity and the
overall notion about quality throughout the organization.

A new question is the
[net promotor score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) for teams:

> If I had a good friend who is looking for a new job, would I recommend them to
> apply here?

If there is one question that summarizes my understanding of a great place to
work is: would I want my friends to work here, too?

I let my colleagues fill out the anonymous form every other month, prior to
all-hands meetings.

I use Google Forms and give all colleagues an exact date and time when to fill
out the form. This disables any form of tracking / assigning individual answers
to team members.

During the all-hands meeting we go through the (accumulated) results and talk
about what we can do to improve the ratings. The discussion alone is brilliant
and the questionnaire is a great starter for this (necessary) discussion.
Nevertheless, it helps you to keep track of the progress in tackling the issues
that arise.

These are the 14 questions, I've also translated them into German for a better
understanding. Questions are answered in a range between 1 to 10. I keep the
resulting median of all answers in a wiki as a history.

1.  Do I know what is expected of me at work?  
    _Weiß ich, was man von mir auf der Arbeit erwartet?_

2.  Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?  
    _Verfüge ich über die Mittel und Ausstattung um meine Arbeit richtig zu
    machen?_

    _Habe ich jeden Tag die Gelegenheit, mein Bestes zu geben?_

4.  In the last 7 days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good
    work?  
    _Habe ich in den letzten 7 Tagen Anerkennung oder Lob für meine Arbeit

    _Schätzt mich mein Vorgesetzter oder jemand anderes auf der Arbeit als

6.  Is there someone at work who encourages my development?  
    _Gibt es jemanden auf der Arbeit, der mich zur Weiterentwicklung ermutigt?_

    goal?  
    _Engagieren sich alle Mitarbeiter voll für das Unternehmensziel?_
