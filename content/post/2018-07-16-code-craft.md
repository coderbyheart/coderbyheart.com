It's amazing what Pete Goodliffe managed to compile in the 558 pages of
[this book](https://amzn.to/2uuB3CQ) on software development (subtitle _The
Practice of Writing Excellent Code_) which was published back in 2007.

The author takes the long road of not only explaining how software is made but
also detailing which individual skills and techniques are needed to produce
software which is of high quality in all aspects. He tackles software-related
topics like architecture, maintainability, documentation, performance,
optimization, source-code management, but does not miss the opportunity to
highlight the importance of communications and that great teamwork is paramount
to producing great software.

I especially liked the way every chapter is structured like a course: following
a short overview, we are taken from the fundamentals of every topic to the state
of the art, and closing with a set of tasks and questions to get the reader
thinking, in parts alone but also as a team.

The book has aged well, everything is still relevant today and I can highly
recommend this book for any aspiring software developer. It is also a great
_workbook_ if you are developing an internal apprenticeship program or software
developer curriculum.

It may be the best software developer compendium available today.
