I recently blogged about [How to find a CTO](./how-to-find-a-cto). An important
role in your search for your CTO or any other development role is your job page.
Don't miss the chance to impress a curious developer because **every** candidate
will browse your website to look up your job postings.

I have a shocking idea for you: ditch the bullet-pointed job description. First
and foremost you are looking for a team member with a broad range of skills to
join you on a year long journey. It's more important to find a person who is
smart, curious, genuinely interested in your business and most important a match
for your team culture than a match to your current tech stack.

You should start the job posting by explaining what you do as a business and why
it matters to help you to achieve this goal. You might call this a vision if you
don't have a product. It's this vision that drives everyone in your company to
give their best.

Next you should describe what the position is responsible for. Explain this by
describing the typical workflows and tasks. This is a good spot to include tools
and technologies that are used in your tech stack. I recommend that you assign a
relevant team member to the position to be available for answering questions.
Display his position, his name and his email.

You should finish by explaining what you offer in return. Talk about the things
that you do to make your employees happier, healthier and more productive. Don't
forget to include links to company rating sites like
[glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com) or [kununu](http://www.kununu.com/).

And don't forget to make sure that every job posting has a unique page with a
sharable permanent url, includes the date of publication and is taken down
immediately once the position is no longer available. A side note on publication
dates: a lot of companies do not remove their job postings and the can linger on
their website for month. If possible display the current month and year as the
date of publication. This signals that the job offer is still valid and
up-to-date.

Below I've compile a list of good examples for job posts and hiring sites:

- [Mindvalley](http://www.mindvalley.com/careers) is pure porn when it comes to
  company job websites
- [Supercell](http://supercell.com/en/careers/) is technically impressive, which
  conveys their work
- [Buffer](https://bufferapp.com/journey/back-end-developer) has become a great
  example for a company built on culture so it's no wonder they have outstanding
  job postings
- [Expensify](http://we.are.expensify.com/) goes great lengths to give you an
  insight in how awesome their team is
- [Blizzard](http://eu.blizzard.com/de-de/company/careers/culture.html) is known
  for their great company culture and they are doing a fantastic job telling you
  about it
- [Goodgame Studios](http://www.goodgamestudios.com/de/karriere/karriere-bei-goodgame/)
  is another well executed example

I know those examples are big and take a lot effort to build but you can start
small:

- [DeinBus](http://mach.deinbus.de/besser/) looking for a backend developer _(I
  wrote this one myself (in german), so its natural to include it here.)_
- [Vaamo](http://codecraft.vaamo.de/jobs/) finds a good balance between standing
  out and keeping the job page lean.

And progress from there by fleshing out a little:

- [Zenmate](https://zenmate.com/jobs/) has a nice one-pager
- [Quäntchen und Glück](https://www.qundg.de/jobs/) are a little heavy on the
  text side, but what they are writing is what makes them special
- [GitHub](https://github.com/about/jobs) finds a good balance between
  simplicity and emotionality

I hope this helps you in building a great job posting.  
But don't forget that this is only a small part of the things you have to do to
attract great talent.
