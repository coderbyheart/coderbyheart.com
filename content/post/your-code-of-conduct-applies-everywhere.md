We had an interesting discussion at [SoCraCan](https://SoCraCan.com/) about
whether we should allow people to attend the event, if they had behaved in a way
that violates the event’s Code of Conduct _outside_ of the event. What if that
person “behaves” during the event? Wouldn’t it be unfair towards them to exclude
them? Maybe they have changed?

To me there is only one clear action that an organiser can take: do not allow a
person to join your event if they have shown behaviour that would harm the
safety of any participant. Otherwise, allow people to enter your space that
otherwise would create harm to others. Event though this would be technically
_outside_ of your event’s space, it nevertheless does not create a safe space
for all participants according to your Code of Conduct.

There simply is no separation between “outside” and “inside” behaviour when it
comes to harassment and toxicity. You, as an organiser, owe it to your
participants to do everything possible to prevent harm from being created.
Trusting the harasser on that is not a smart move.
