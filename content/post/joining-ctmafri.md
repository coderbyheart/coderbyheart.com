I've joined the Advisory Board of
[CreaTech Motives Afrika](https://www.ctmafri.com/) as a technical advisor.

CreaTech is a Ghana-based initiative that creates educational programs that aim
to teach young children programming skills and inspire them to become the next
generation of problem solvers and tech entrepreneurs in Ghana.

I support the leadership of CreaTech Motives Afrika as a technical advisor as
part of their advisory board.

One of their projects is [algo peers](https://algopeers.com/) which is supported
by the [micro:bit foundation](https://microbit.org/) and my employer
[Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com/News/2021/09/Nordic-helps-back-digital-education-for-disadvantaged-students-in-Nigeria)
and I got the chance to speak to the team a while ago (please excuse my bad
audio in the recording):
