If you think you want to talk about something you are _passionate_ about you are
already a step further than 99%.

Write a proposal — 99.9% don’t.

See [speaking.io](https://speaking.io/) for great resources on how to get
started. Also check out
[this thread](https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose/status/1041242744998572032) on
Twitter.

Submit to conferences that cover travel expenses
([#paytospeak](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23paytospeak&src=typd))  
and have a **good** Code of Conduct.

If they don’t, ask why!

Find conferences who are calling for proposals on: [SeeCFP](http://seecfp.com/)
or [Papercall](https://www.papercall.io/).
