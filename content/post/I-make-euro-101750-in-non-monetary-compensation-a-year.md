Salary is probably one of the most dreadful topics, especially because it is a
[hygiene factor][hf]: earning _not enough_ money will affect your satisfaction
greatly, but earning more than you need won't improve your performance equally
strong.

## What is enough?

Let's talk a little bit about _enough_: the actual sum that you need to live
depends on your fixed costs for basics like food, rent and savings for your
retirement. If you have kids or other relatives to take care of, add this on
top. Once those are paid you usually spend money on vacation, hobbies, and other
activities like going to a concert, eating out, etc. Your _enough_ quickly
amounts to a sum that is already greater than the average salary in Germany
([roughly €44,000 per year gross][gs]). But let's take that sum as _enough_.

Of course, I don't want to make what is _enough_ but optimize for what _is
adequate_ for my position. But how much exactly is that? If we take open salary
examples from around the world, many feature a _market-average base-salary_:
developers are rare, thus they will earn more money than accountants. It is easy
to get an overview about the typical salary for your market by looking at sites
like [glassdoor][gd]; for Germany the [salary overview by Robert Half][so] is
very helpful if your industry is IT.

Where you are in the range depends on many factors, mostly experience, but even
greater, your ability to (over-)sell yourself has a big impact on your salary
especially in Germany, where you rarely find a role which compensation is made
public in the job offer. The motivation to make compensations an individual
agreement seems obvious: to save the company money, because they can try to
negotiate the lowest possible salary for each employee. This is a fallacy,
though. [Studies show][ts] that making compensation transparent and comparable
within an organization, will save money.

## The gap between _enough_ and _adequate_ is your playing field!

It's important to remember: monetary compensation has no benefit, above the
individual threshold that is perceived to be _enough_. For organizations that
hire talent that is in high demand it is important to understand that you need
to match this threshold. **But:** the gap between _enough_ and _adequate_ is
your playing field; you can't keep employees below their _enough_ for a
sustainable amount of time, but they are flexible in the range above that.

Organizations can even overcompensate here, and this is what this blog post is
about. Don't get me wrong, it's not about sugarcoating low salaries by just
giving them another name. It's about understanding that the money a company
spends on salary can be spent—in parts—in better ways. For companies this can
make a big difference, increase your runway (the amount of time until your
startup goes out of business), hire more talent, invest more in new products,
etc.

## I make €101,750 in non-monetary compensation a year

There is real money to make, if you find the perks, that really matter (not
foosball tables and fruit baskets). To give you a concrete example, I compiled
the list of my non-monetary compensations and assigned a price tag to them.

**The total of the list above sums up to €101,750 per year in non-monetary
compensation!** Which makes me a happy man to get a compensation in total which
is way above the market average for a comparable position.

The tricky part is, especially when talking to developers: they are
bird-in-the-hand-people and it will take some effort to have this talk about a
lower-than-average fixed salary with them. This will greatly affect your hiring,
especially if you are secretive about your organization. Because no one will
believe the advertorial speak of a founder because of what I described earlier:
they expect tactics to reduce salary behind it. A better approach will be to be
open about your culture and encourage your employees to evangelize working at
your company. See? Openness and transparency, they are key for the next
generation of organizations.

Yes, some of the perks listed above are real spendings for the company, but the
net-worth of an Euro spent there is €1 compared to an Euro spent with my net
salary will equal roughly €0.49. So in the end, both the company and me will
benefit greatly from having this discussion.
