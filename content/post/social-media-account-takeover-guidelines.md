This is a gray area because here the individual employee becomes part of a
corporate communication strategy and the company on the one hand is much more
resilient to negative experiences compared to the individual. Therefore it is
the responsibility of the company to ensure that the employee is protected
against negative experiences as much as possible.

This document provides a code of conduct for these account Takeovers in order to
enable the employee, the social media team, and the followers to have meaningful
and positive interactions during and after a Takeover

## What are Account Takeovers?

So called “Account Takeovers” are a way for companies to give a more personal
look into the day to day work at the organization. An employee is responsible
for posting updates on the social media account for a day. This is an effective
tool for companies to engage with a diverse audience and provide content that is
more natural to the audience and not the usual streamlined marketing content.

For employees this provides the opportunity to provide an in-depth insight into
their daily work which often can be very obscure and therefore attract people to
apply for open jobs or engage with the specific product the employee is working
with in order to provide more detailed feedback.

In both cases the point is to put an individual employee in the center of the
attention during the takeover. This however opens them up to receive unwanted
attention in the form of inappropriate or harassing questions and personal
messages, especially when it’s people from under-indexed groups that are being
put in the spotlight.

The employee might not be experienced in ways to protect themselves against
these comments or—because they are representing the company—may be inclined to
interact with harassers to keep “good appearances” because “the customer is
always right”.

## For the social media team

1. Assume that the employee doing the takeover has no or very limited experience
   handling social media interactions on an account with a large number of
   followers. Therefore you must ensure that they are protected against
   unwanted, inappropriate or harassing comments or questions.
1. Share a Code of Conduct before the Takeover:  
   “In order to have a wonderful experience together, please keep your
   questions, comments and interactions professional. Do not comment or ask
   about personal appearances, relationship status or similar private details.
   This is not a dating site.”
1. Moderate all interactions: do not let the employee receive messages
   unfiltered by giving them direct access to the social media account. Have an
   experienced social media manager screen all questions and forward only
   appropriate ones via the company's chat app. For example on Instagram, the
   employee then can use their Instagram app to provide the story via a private
   message to the company account.
1. If a users posts an inappropriate question, reprimand them immediately with a
   clear message:  
   “Hei, your comment is inappropriate and hurtful and adds to making tech a
   place that is exclusive and hostile. We will not answer these kinds of
   questions. Stop it.”
1. If they repeat their inappropriate actions, block them without further
   comment.
1. Make sure the employee does not share their private Instagram account
   details. Do not ask the employee to do so.

## For the person doing the Takeover

It is fantastic that you have decided to lend your face and personality to your
organization. It is a gift and its value cannot be measured monetarily. Here are
few rules to help you make this an amazing experience:

1. You do not need to answer questions that you are not comfortable with. If
   some questions make you comfortable please let the social media team know so
   they can filter out these types of questions.
1. Do not share your personal social media account unless you personally want
   to. Your employer’s social media team will not ask you to do so. If you do
   nevertheless, feel free to ignore and block unwanted users without
   explanation. This is your personal space. You do not owe these users
   anything.
1. Please be aware that all content you provide will end up on the internet
   beyond the control of your organization. Share only what you are comfortable
   with being accessible to a wide audience forever.

## For the audience

As a participant you too need to be involved in making takeovers a fun
experience for everyone. Ask questions about the business, or the workday of the
employee. Just see this as an opportunity to get to know an interesting company
and a future colleague a bit better. Simply do not try to get in their pants.
Social Media accounts of companies are not a dating platform, and any unwanted
attention without consent is inappropriate here digitally, as it is at the
workplace.
