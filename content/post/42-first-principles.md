In 2022 I am turning 42 and therefore I am writing down my 42
[first principles](/first-principles). This is most likely going to take the
entire year, and I plan to publish rough drafts on a weekly basis in this blog.

I want to take the time to get them into a form that is more permanent, and more
stringent than the list of GitHub issues,
[I've collected already](https://github.com/coderbyheart/first-principles/issues).

~~The _first principle #1_ is not yet on that list, though.~~ I have to start
with putting these principles into context. They are mine only and not intended
to be a list of _shoulds_, and therefore I must talk first about the
[privilege](/principle/privilege) I have to be working in the tech industry
since 1997, and being able to work in it uninterrupted now in the 25th year.

You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart), or if you
prefer to receive an email,
[shoot me a reminder](mailto:m@coderbyheart.com?subject=42%20first%20principles&body=Let%20me%20know%20if%20there%20is%20new%20content%21).
