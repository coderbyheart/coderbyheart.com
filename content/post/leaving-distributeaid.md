After three years contributing code and organizational wisdom to
[DistributeAid](https://distributeaid.org/) I am saying _good bye_ to this
amazing project. I had the opportunity to work with amazingly skilled and
passionate people on making aid available who have to flee their countries and
are held in cages at the European borders.

My reason to leave is that I am not able to work on projects that I find
interesting, but this is not DistributeAid's fault. There are meaningful things
to work on, however I owe it to myself to make good use of my time.

I've kicked of some important changes within the organization and maybe a few
years from now there is a new opportunity to return.
