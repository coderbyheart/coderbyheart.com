I first heard about DistributeAid at Øredev 2019 in Malmö, and was immediately
inspired by their idea to use technology to improve the distribution of donated
goods for displaced people. And in the last three years we have seen that the
network of grassroots organizations which DistributeAid supports is needed to
help people who have been affected by political and ecological disasters, caused
after all by the global north, which I have the privilege and luck to be born
in. Besides the ongoing imprisonment of migrants and asylum-seekers on the
southern European borders, DistributeAid's team helped with logistics during the
COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and the United States. And most recently got
involved in welcoming Afghan families to the United States after Kabul was taken
over by the Taliban in 2021. The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian dictator
Putin in 2022 created yet another region where DistributeAid is involved to
provide people with basic everyday items.

As a code contributor to DistributeAid's projects, which you can find on their
GitHub repository [github.com/distributeaid](https://github.com/distributeaid/),
I can work on digital tools that are used to achieve the organization's goals. I
worked on a digital COVID-19 guide for aid organizations, integrated APIs from
shipping partners, and most recently built a low-code tools used to assess the
needs of aid groups they support. I enjoy that DistributeAid has a people-first
approach to contributions and we try to provide software projects that are both
easy to get started with and easy to change. After all, done is better than
perfect and areas of focus can change quickly. Because we contributors are
distributed around the world, we need to keep our codebases well in shape, which
means that we write a lot of tests, and keep our documentation up to date, so
others can contribute big and small features without needing to be in the loop
constantly and new contributes can start with smaller items quickly.

What has kept me engaged with DistributeAid over nearly three years now is
knowing that the code that I write is making a difference. And I am extremely
impressed by Sara, Taylor and many other contributors who put their professional
skills into this project without making this about themselves. Everyone is
extremely humble and helpful. I wish all tech projects could be like this. And
then I wish we wouldn't need DistributeAid. This is the dichotomy we all face
when engaging with DistributAid. But this team has your back, because everyone
knows that you can't burn the candle at both ends and you need to be in good
mental state, before you can help others.

If you are interested to contribute to our projects, just reach out to me, or
any other Distribute Aid team member!
