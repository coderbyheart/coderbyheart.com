This post series is a summary of my talk about the challenge working in
distributed teams
[I held at this year's TopConf in Linz](http://topconf.com/linz-2016/trackevent/there-is-no-half-remote-team/).

It's a 40 minute talk so I decided to split it into three separate posts, each
on focusing on one challenge:

1. [the missing watercooler](./working-remote-fix-the-missing-watercooler/)
2. [quality together-time](./working-remote-quality-together-time/)
3. [celebrate successes](./working-remote-celebrate-successes/)
