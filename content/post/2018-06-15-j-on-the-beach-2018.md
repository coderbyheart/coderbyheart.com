End of May I had the opportunity to fly to Malaga in Spain and speak at
[J on the Beach](https://jonthebeach.com/).

This was one of the most exciting conference experiences for me. The conference
took place in a historic bath house, which had been turned into a event
location. It was perfectly equipped with air-conditioned rooms featuring
sound-systems, beamers and cinema-chairs, a great, green outdir area and-as the
name implies-is directly located at the beach in Malaga. I could not resist to
use the opportunity to take a swim in the (still cold) sea!

The attendees and also speaker linup was very diverse: out of 56 speakers, 20
were women (36%). It was fantastic to see that the organizers effort to attract
speakers from underrepresented groups paid off.

Although this conference started as a Java conference, this was hardly
noticable. I enjoyed many great talks and also my own talk (the one about IoT
and JavaScript) was very well received, I had a full room and received great
feedback.

I can highly recommend this conference and will definetly come back, not only
because there is a direct flight from Trondheim to Malaga, but because I'd like
to spend more time in this beautiful city.
