For the third year now I am participating in
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), which provides a daily programming
challenge with increasing difficulty.

I am publishing my solutions written in TypeScript and following TDD
[on GitHub](https://github.com/coderbyheart/adventofcode/tree/2020).
