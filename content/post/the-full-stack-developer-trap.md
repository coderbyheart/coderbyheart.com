  I realized that there is a full-stack developer trap: your work is evaluated based on your best skill, which unfulfillable expectations.

I would consider myself to be a full stack developer, but my strength is
building backend systems for complex processes. My career started as a frontend
developer and I have been building frontends throughout my various types of
employment of the last 19+ years. I'd say I know frontend technologies VERY
well. And this knowledge gets me very far even compared to frontend developers.

Because I know how everything works together, and I also have been educated in
design theory, usability, it's easy for me to use frontend frameworks to build
production quality frontend components.

But going beyond that, we are looking at UX and _in the end_ hard UI design
problems: going from Bootstrap to the next level, is something _I can't do_.

And this is where it gets tricky: If I'm confronted with a backend task, I can
always go further and provide excellent solutions, because backend code for
processing data, talking to to other services, scaling infrastructure, failure
tolerance is my passion. Frontend code for mitigating browsers bugs, UI effects,
positioning elements, animation: _a sometimes interesting but mostly just
necessary thing_.

But for a non-technical founder, though, they do not make this difference
between backend and frontend work. My work is evaluated based on my _best_
skill, which creates unfulfillable expectations. And they will implicitly expect
my frontend work results to be equally sophisticated as my backend work.

I maneuver myself into this trap by using frameworks like Bootstrap. They enable
me to have great looking _standard_ components, without designing. But for
everything _custom_, it gets hard, and there needs to be designers, UI/UX
experts.

I know this from the start, but at this point it's actually too late. It's now
really hard to explain that to your founders and team, that they road you had
taken them on is not getting just a little bumpy, but ends _now_, at a cliff.

## Here is what you can do

**Make your skill distribution and preference explicit when working in the full
stack role.**

As a full stack developer your are sought after in early stage startups, small
teams because you can deliver everything technically they need in one person.

Make clear for which of the many roles you hold, you expect to be replaced and
how quickly and what you want to keep doing _forever_.

This will help your team to commit to finding a replacement for you from the
start of a project. And you will spend more time working with what you can
**and** love to do.

I know this sounds contradictory to the term full stack developer, but I've
never met one that truly excels in and loves both disciplines.

I think there is a better term for that: next time I'll introduce myself as a
_backend developer and full stack literate_.
