![Podio discloses extensive user information and claims its users have agreed to it.](../media/for-usd24-podio-gives-you-the-names-faces-and-contact-details-of-their/hero.png)

I've been a big fan of Podio for many years and I recently discovered a nice
_feature_: once you sign up to [Podio](https://podio.com/) and pay for the
Premium Plan: you become connected through more than 2,600 other premium users
through becoming part of the same Network in order to use their automation
product [globiflow](http://www.globiflow.com/).

This gives you access to extended personal information:

- Full name
- Title
- Email
- Phone Number
- City
- Personal description / About
- Photo
- State
- Country
- Skype
- Location
- Address
- Postcode
- Website
- IM

The information is presented in a nicely formatted way, so I was able to extract
the data for all users within a few minutes in a nice spreadsheet.

I think this is highly problematic because this provides a gold mine for
phishing attacks: I could find members who belong to the same organization and
use Podio as a pretext to send them arbitrary emails (_Hey Bratt, I shared this
Podio View with you!_) containing dangerous links.

## Two months ago I reached out to the Podio support

I asked them to remove this feature, however they claim that this is perfectly
fine.

This is the answer I received:

No, this is **not** what I would expect from a paid product like Podio.
Especially looking at the linked article, it does not state that "profile
details will be visible to other users" but instead uses "colleagues".

Colleagues are by definition not **all podio users**. With colleagues I (or the
manager of the podio account I belong to) has control over who sees my data.
This is not the case with the "connection" feature where I do not have ways to
control who sees my data.

I can only encourage Premium Podio users to educate themselves about this
_"feature"_ and reach out to the Podio support so this disclosure of extensive
personal information will be stopped.

## Update 4. July 2019

I received a reply from Podio support to the original request I made two month
ago:

> I understand your point of view here and thanks a lot for bringing this up.  
> We are working towards making this more transparent to users so that users can
> decide what information they would want to keep public.
>
> Will be releasing out information once we have more clarity on the plan and
> approach.

## Update 8. July 2019

Podio responded to
[the Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Podio/status/1148152555177857026):

## Update 11. July 2019

Podio updated the
[help article](https://help.podio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201019378-Updating-and-editing-your-profile)
and added a section which explains that profile information is shared with
everyone:

> **Public Profile Information** Profile information can be seen by all of your
> connections in Podio. This means all of your colleagues, external members that
> you collaborate with, and members inside of community workspaces that youâ€™re
> apart of will all have the ability to view your Podio Profile information. You
> can edit and remove any unwanted profile information at anytime by editing
> your profile information.
>
> Shared Profile Information:
>
> - Profile Picture
> - Email
> - Phone
> - Location
> - Address

They also added a prominent warning presnted to GlobiFlow users when joining
that workspace:

![PII GlobiFlow](../media/for-usd24-podio-gives-you-the-names-faces-and-contact-details-of-their/PII_GlobiFlow.png)

In addition they plan to upldate the "Edit Profile" feature:

> For long term, we would also be updating our in-product "Edit Profile" page
> later to call out what all information is public and what is not, so that
> users can take an informed decision while adding their details.
