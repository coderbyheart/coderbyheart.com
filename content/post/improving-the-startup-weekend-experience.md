  Improving the Startup Weekend Experience
abstract: |
  In my opinion the default shedule for the weekend is not educating the teams enough to focus on what matters in those 54 hours: *validate their assumptions* about the business idea and *prepare a presentation*. For this year I've created a new shedule which includes more concrete deliverables and divides the weekend into distinct slots.

I've been organizing and attending more then a dozen events in the format of a
Startup Weekend in the past three years. In my opinion the
[default shedule](https://gist.github.com/coderbyheart/fda7f88914752c8a7637) for
the weekend as proposed by the up.com, the Startup Weekend Organization, is not
educating the teams enough to focus on what matters in those 54 hours: _validate
their assumptions_ about the business idea and _prepare a presentation_.
Therefore I've created a new shedule which includes more concrete deliverables
and divides the weekend into distinct slots which put the focus on them. The
goal is to prepare and equip every team with the material and knowledge they
need to talk to investors and new team membersâ€“because this is what they will be
doing after the weekend.

## The new schedule at a glance

- The _Friday_ schedule is kept unchanged. The difference is that once the teams
  have formed their task is to **deliver their mission statement and an elevator
  pitch**.
- The task for _Saturday_ morning is to **define three assumptions** about the
  business, e.g. why this idea will succeed, who are the customers, what is the
  market. The team then uses the time after lunch until dinner to **evaluate the
  assumptions** by going into the city to conduct interviews and finding their
  first real customers.
- _Sunday_ is dedicated to **building a compelling pitch**. This can be in the
  form of a presentation or a prototype. It is important to focus on every
  aspect of the idea: business, realization, team, uniqueness, and wit!
- The schedule also includes more clearly defined slots for the presence of the
  coaches.

## Deliverables

Teams are tasked to deliver:

- a written mission statement (max. 10 words)
- an elevator pitch (max. 1000 characters)
- written assumptions about their business and evaluation plan
- a written evaluation of those assumptions
- a business plan presentation (max. 3 slides)
- a pitch slidedeck
