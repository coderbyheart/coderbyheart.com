This is a small lecture I gave to a team of students on how to approach
designing the software architecture for a cellular IoT project.

It uses the [Nordic nRF9160](https://www.nordicsemi.com/products/nrf9160) as a
habit tracker in a 12 sided enclosure and connects to
[AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/).

In the talk I speak about:

- design considerations
- how to separate work between three teams
- make sure the project is aligned with the user's goals
- how end-to-end tests support integration between teams
