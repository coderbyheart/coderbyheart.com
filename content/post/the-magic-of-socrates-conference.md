It's the fifth installement of the yearly conference centered around the idea
that
[software developement is a craft](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)
and if you consider yourself to be a software developer you would be doing
yourself and your peers a favour if you constantly improve yourself.

The [Socrates Conference](https://www.socrates-conference.de/) creates through
contribution of every participant an environment where you can let yourself
wander around in over a hundred sessions with topics ranging from technical
topics like domain driven design, software testing or functional programming to
team building, hiring, meditation and board games. Every single item on the
session board is proposed and hosted by the participants &mdash; there is no
sponsored track, no product show or hackathon. You'll get absorbed in a flood of
new ideas, fascinating concepts and compelling questions and you leave with you
head buzzing and the warm feeling that we as an industry are not solely made of
people that hunt the next big thing and compromise their personal freedom, their
health and their empathy.

[#socrates15](https://twitter.com/hashtag/socrates15?src=hash) attendees also
want to get rich: rich in ideas, options and connections &mdash; this is for me
an important part in becomming a better software developer. Please join us next
year!
