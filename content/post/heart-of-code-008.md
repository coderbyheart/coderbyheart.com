With ❤️.of(code) number 8 I'm finally back at the regular schedule: recapping my
week in Twitter, every Sunday.

### Tech 🚀

A report on the state of automated testing came out:

Five hours of setup, for two hours of LAN party:

Mozilla is the poster child of open-source:

AWS has some quirky behaviour when it comes to lambdas and environment
variables, so use Parameter Store. I do and it works great.
[Not only for that](https://github.com/coderbyheart/aws-ssm-keyring).

### JavaScript 🛠

npm now has 2FA and read-only tokens:

JavaScript (in contrast to Python) has no hard to explain concepts (like list
comprehensions). It's a great beginners language:

Node.js is everywhere:

### Diversity 🌈

It's sad that this is still not a thing:
[equal pay](http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/csw/equal-pay).

Verena tells her experience with RailsGirls (Thread):

Studies show that men won't believe evidence when it comes to gender bias:

### Culture ✌️

You should follow [Substack](https://twitter.com/substack), not only for their
opinion:

Do this and the whole company will benefit (emphasis on **measurable**!):

Don't trust a consultancy that sells you the Spotify model. It's does not exist!

Thread with great resources on changing organizations:

A BarCamp in my former hometown:
