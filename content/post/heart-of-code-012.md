It has been a wet week here in Trondheim. On Monday we had the first snowfall of
the season:

But luckily Saturday gave me only wet feet on the 19km hike from the Skistua
Busstop up to

### JavaScript 🛠

A quick reminder, that TypeScript ist a
[duck-typing system](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html):

> One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape
> that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural
> subtyping”. In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and
> are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts
> with code outside of your project.

which leads to this:

I love Greenkeeper and how it puts some sanity in working with JavaScript
dependencies:
