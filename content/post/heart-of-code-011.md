![Sunrise over Trondheim](../media/heart-of-code-011.jpg)

It's amazing how short the autumn here in Trondheim is, today we had the first
snowfall of the season:

### Jobs / Hiring 💪🏻

Silvia shared a great resource for women looking into a career in tech:

You can also hire her (as a contractor) for your next venture:

I also need to emphasize this:

There is a nice new drag&drop library around (with an awesome demo page):

I started following [Honest Status Page](https://twitter.com/honest_update) for
tweets like this:

### JavaScript 🛠

[Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) is still very high on my _to check out_
bucket list for its promise to improve the way we are writing JavaScript:

The next Node.js LTS release is coming (check out
[this post](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.0.0/) for an overview of the
important changes from v6). I personally like
[`util.promisify`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original)
and
[`Object.values`](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values).

[Node.js 8 enables http2 by default](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V8.md#notable-changes-1),
btw.

Diversity is about potential:

### Culture ✌️

A good article on David Marquet's book Turn The Ship Around:

Here is why teams should own their code, not a single person:
