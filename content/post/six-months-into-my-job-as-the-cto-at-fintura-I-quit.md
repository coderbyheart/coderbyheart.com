Mid-October I handed in my resignation which put and end to one of the most
miserable work experiences I had in my entire career. If you read through the
post that
[I've written after the first month working there](./one-month-into-my-new-job-as-the-cto-at-fintura)
you will find me struggling with explaining my idea and values. One of the
decisive factors was that I could not find support for [my vision](./motivation)
of what makes a great place to work.

But in every bad experience there are still things to learn. In no particular
order, these were:

- culture: I only want to work with a CEO that I have genuine sympathy for
- values: I need to put more effort into making sure that our goals align (go
  read [The Big Five for Life](http://amzn.to/1RRg7Nw)) and happiness (or
  [joy](./joy-inc) is a core value)
- freedom: I work remotely from day one

Still today I'm struggling with the experiences I made last year. I lost a fair
share of trust in people but gained a lot of confidence that the way I lead is
very well received. I cannot but look forward to the next twelve months.
