The _5 whys_ method is one of my favorite methods because it is so simple to
remember and almost naturally to apply in many situations. Whenever you are
presented with a _fact_ (about a task to implement, a bug, or a problem) use
this method to uncover the _true_ origin of this fact.

Given a problem, you ask "Why ... did this happen?", the answer you will find or
be given is not to be taken at face value at first. Instead this cause should be
further analyzed. This process is repeated _at least five times_, only then can
you be sure to be on track of finding the true cause for the problem.

Of course, the number 5, is arbitrarily picked, and can be any number. The point
is to be aware that humans have a bias for making assumptions and giving answers
that follow these assumptions and thereby follow a false path of conclusion.
This ability for quick decision making, using heuristics, has served humans for
a long time, because it yields a higher chance of survival. Daniel Kahneman
calls this _System 1_ in his book _Thinking, Fast and Slow_.

The _5 whys_ method is a deliberate process to break out of this simplified
thought process and engage in true problem analysis (using _System 2_ thinking).

It can be visualized using this flow chart:

The _root cause_ can be reached immediately after the first question, or require
more than 5 iterations. What's needed is the persistence to ask the right
questions, and here a great helper is to identify omissions and assumptions that
were made when identifying the cause.

Assumptions are rather straightforward to identify, they are usually known and
can be uncovered through discussing which assumptions were made when identifying
the cause.

- Problem: _The car does not start_
- Why did this happen: _The starter does not work_
- Cause: _The battery is dead_

The assumption in this analysis is that the dead battery does not supply power
to the starter.

Omissions are harder to identify, but they are relevant when applying this
technique in a discussion with another person. I especially love this part, and
I use it regularly in interviews, or when discussing problems with colleagues or
partners. Here you need to get creative to uncover information that was not
given when providing a cause. The important part here is to keep it a discussion
on eye-level, a problem-focused discovery, not a way to shift responsibility
away from you. You yourself are responsible for helping to uncover the root
cause of the problem. The _5 why_ method therefore is also a tool for
self-reflection and will help to discover your own assumptions, omissions and
contributions to a problem's root cause.

The _5 whys_ method is so powerful because of its simplicity ... but be careful
not to come across as annoying when applying it. Showing persistence in
uncovering fundamental truths takes practice, but always delivers.
