❤️.of(code) number 7 now has the correct week number. _Last_ week was 39.

A day late, because I spent the weekend with a few colleagues from
[Nordic](http://www.nordicsemi.com/ "Nordic Semiconductor") at the
[Kårvatn Fjellgård](https://www.ut.no/hytte/3.2069/) hiking. You can find
[more pictures here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tacker/albums/72157686553724561 "NoVel Høsttur til Kårvatn").

### Culture ✌️

Uncle Bob Martin crapped more shit on Twitter and his Blog. His personal
opinions are disgusting and not tolerable.

The question is, do I reject a book about software he has authored because of
this reason? Can knowledge be tainted?
