Celebrating 2,000 followers on [@coderbyheart](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart)
I decided to sum up my week on Twitter from now on every weekend.

### Tech 🚀

I've been using [Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/focus/)
now for two weeks and I really like it when reading articles from RSS feeds. It
blocks a lot of ads and does not pollute my history with one-shot visits.

Some asshole dude can't deal with a woman, again.

The next thing regarding Facebook and licenses came up. This time:
[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/).

This might explain why I like cooking AND Linux:

### JavaScript 🛠

V8 is now on Twitter:

I've learned a new term: NPM lego.

I am still struggling with TypeScript:

Also, I haven't completely ditched Promises, yet.

With [Chirr](https://getchirrapp.com/) I can finally effortless create a Twitter
thread. Like this one about my visit to Trondheims JavaScript UserGroup
[BartJS](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/BartJS/):

### Web 🌍

Because <em>Web</em> is an ever changing target, our performance optimizations
strategies are also in constant need of revisiting them:

### Diversity 🌈

A longer article about [Project Include](https://twitter.com/projectinclude)
highlights some of their methods:

### Culture✌️

Very well said:

> "We don't have enough experts" You 👏 have 👏 to 👏 start 👏 training 👏 some!

Nordic understands that, and investe in roughly 40 paid summer interns:

Also culture, but different:
