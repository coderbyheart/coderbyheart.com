I'm really excited to be mentoring 4 teams (of 50) from the
[Asia Pacific College](https://www.apc.edu.ph/) on the Philippines as part of a
three months [CodeDoor](https://codedoor.com/About) and
[IBM SkillsBuild](https://skillsbuild.org/) bootcamp that teaches students how
software can be used to tackle important problems. They will be focusing on
natural disasters. This is going to be amazing!
