So, you are attending a startup weekend? You will be crammed in a room with
strangers to collaborate on an idea-maybe even yours? I have some advice for you
to improve your output during this 54 hours.

Use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) to work on concept documents,
texts, spreadsheets for your business plan and the presentation. Everyone can
work on every document at the same time and all collaborators will see updates
in real time. Don't even try to work with files during the weekend.

If you need to share files, use
[Bittorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/download). It doesn't rely on
central internet servers like Dropbox and can transmit files on the local (W)LAN
with insane speed. No registration required-you'll be sharing files in minutes.

Use [Trello](https://trello.com/coderbyheart/recommend) to manage your tasks.
It's super easy to get started and you'll have an easy way to prioritize what
should be done next and track what is going on.

Use [Slack](https://slack.com/) for team communication. This provides a clear
separation of communication for your project, it runs on any device and nobody
has share his phone number. Yes, don't even think about using WhatsApp. I mean
it!

If you are building an MVP, use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to share and
collaborate on your code, it even provides free hosting for
[your landingpage](https://pages.github.com/). You should
[create an organization](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account/)
for your project.

Bring headphones or earplugs. It will get loud sometimes, and you will need to
concentrate. You should bring some music, too. Or just tune in to
[ETN](http://etn.fm/).

And last but not least: enjoy yourself and take the startup weekend as an exotic
escape from your day job. You can be a totally different person here, you know?
