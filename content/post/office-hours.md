In the last two years I’ve dived into the Rhein-Main startup scene working for
startups and foremost trying to build a solid foundation that enables startups
to grow. An important part of this foundation is a network of people you can
trust and who can give you unbiased advice without a hidden agenda. Those are
hard to find even if I think giving advice can be a lot a fun-which I had at
last year's [Startup Weekend Rhein-Main][1].

Even if I believe that Rhein-Main neither can _nor should_ follow Berlin's lead
in terms of Startups I do want to see disruptive, innovative and creative
tech-startups in the area, because those will shape the Rhein-Main area and be
built by people I want to work with in the future …

That's why I'll offer free bimonthly office hours either on Google Hangout or at
the Coworking Space [Die Zentrale][3] in Frankfurt Bornheim Mitte starting
January 2015. Talk to me about technology, building software, managing teams or
your organization, whether you have a vague idea or a specific problem. And if I
can't help you I'll probably know someone who does.

Email me at [m@coderbyheart.com][2] with a short intro and a link to your
LinkedIn or XING profile and pick a free slot and I'll get back to you to
confirm our meeting.
