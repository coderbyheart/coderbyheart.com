![Trondheim in Autumn Colours](../media/2017-10-15-heart-of-code-009.jpg)

It's now autumn here in Trondheim, bringing beautiful colors to, as you can see
in the picture above.

### Jobs / Hiring 💪🏻

Let's start with this one first: we are hiring for two roles to join the team I
am working in (and on [nRFCloud.com](https://nrfcloud.com/). The first role is
an experienced backend developer to join the half of the team that works from
the Portland office (check out
[the pictures from my recent trip there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tacker/albums/72157689530779415).

We are also hiring a senior-ish frontend developer for Trondheim, more details
coming soon!

I have never worked in a more diverse team than here at Nordic Semiconductor, so
please apply!

If you won't move to Trondheim, maybe this one is for you:
