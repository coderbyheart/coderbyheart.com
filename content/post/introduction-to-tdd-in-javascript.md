Since I am remote and a little disconnected from the day to day mentoring I have
decided to try something new in 2018 for my mentoring at
[CodeDoor](http://codedoor.org/).

I've created a coding challenge at
[github.com/coderbyheart/codedoor-challenges](https://github.com/coderbyheart/codedoor-challenges)
(and I plan to add more) which contains real-world problems in a real-world
JavaScript project set-up how I am using it every day at work.

The goal is for beginners to get a little more familiar with GitHub and receive
an introduction to
[Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
&mdash; a way to write software which gives you immidiate feedback about the
quality of the code you are writing.

Later on I plan to introduce challenges that cover the
[S.O.L.I.D. architecture principle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)>).

These challenges are not for total beginners, you should have implemented a
handful of solutions in JavaScript already.

Please let me know if you want to start working on the first challenge, and join
the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/codedoor-challenges/Lobby), so I can
support you. Alternatively you can
[DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart/).
