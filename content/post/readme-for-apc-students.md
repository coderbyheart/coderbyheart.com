[I am mentoring students](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart/status/1334426175565934592)
and I gave them a README for my weekly office hour.

I ask them for 4 things every week, because I think these are very important
_for them_:

1. note progress
1. get clarity on goals
1. identify where you struggle
1. say thank you

I am doing this so they develop habits that will benefit them later in their
work life:

1. _note progress_: it's important to capture the things you _did_. This is data
   which is very useful to keep stakeholders up to date. But it also provides a
   great source for review and appraisal meetings with managers. If they are not
   frequent you will most likely have forgotten what you did a few months ago. A
   log of things you did will help you identify important milestones you
   reached.
1. _get clarity on goals_: working on software projects is highly complex and
   it's easy to loose sight of the bigger picture. Many small problems pile up
   and can easily obscure the initial goal that was set at the beginning of a
   project. Stating (and reinforcing) the goals you work towards is important to
   keep everyone aligned to work towards the same outcome. Clarity on thy _Why?_
   is neccessary to be able to quickly make daily decisions without depending on
   long feedback cycles.
1. _identify where you struggle_: I've put this in to normalize the fact that
   hitting blockers is normal, it is part of doing something new that hasn't
   been done before but also part of learning something new. Very few concepts
   will just reveal themselves on the first look, it takes time and practice to
   understand them. Sharing what you struggle with also provides the opportunity
   for team members to offer help and support; after all they might have had the
   same issue in the past and know how to handle it. It is also important to
   enable the entire team to identify blockers that limit progress and evaluate
   wether to invest into resolving them immediately.
1. _say thank you_: Actionable feedback is the most important input for a team
   to improve and grow. I especially highlight that it's about providing
   feedback on what a person _did_, this offers them concrete feedback on their
   behaviour and what is perceived as valuable by their team members. This can
   also help them uncover skills they didn't know they posessed or didn't think
   of being valuable.

## README: Office Hours

In order to maximize the time for questions please post the questions you have
in the Teams chat **before** the office hour. I will answer them following the
[FIFO](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_In_%E2%80%93_First_Out) principle.

## Status updates

### Individual

**Each student** should provide an individual _small_ status update **every
Thursday** in Teams:

1. Describe one interesting thing you learned in the past week.
1. Upload one screenshot of your week's work progress.
1. Describe one thing you struggle with.
1. Write a virtual
   [Kudo card](https://www.scrumdesk.com/kudo-cards-tool-for-motivation-and-retrospective-in-one/)
   to a team member (you can do this privately if you like).  
   Here is a template:

```
For:   <Name of your team member>
From:  <Your Name>
For:   Thank you for <description of what they did>
       because it <description of how it helped you>
```

### Team

**Each team** should provide a written status update **every Thursday** in
Teams:

1. Describe the goals you were working towards this week and the progress you
   made towards them.
1. Describe the blockers you encounter.
1. Describe what you plan to work on next week.
