# Hei ðŸ‘‹, I am Markus.

I live in Trondheim, Norway ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ and share photos about my camping adventures and

[Instagram](https://instagram.com/coderbyheart).

My professional career has been greatly influenced by taking an active role in
communities, whether as a participant, contributor, community initiator, or
speaker.

I especially enjoys the diverse and deep discussion of the
[Software Craft Community](https://softwerkskammer.org/).
