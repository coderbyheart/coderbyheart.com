# Hei ðŸ‘‹, I am Markus.

**I'm a coder by heart and an organizational hacker by passion.**

As a
[Software Crafter](https://coderbyheart.com/become-a-certified-software-craftsperson/)
I am using my 20+ years of experience working as a software developer,
consultant, coach, mentor, and founder to build cloud-based solutions for the
Internet of Things using JavaScript at
[Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com/).

I am [@coderbyheart](https://twitter.com/coderbyheart) on Twitter, you can

> I live in Trondheim, Norway ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ and share photos about my camping adventures

My professional career has been greatly influenced by taking an active role in
communities, whether as a participant, contributor, community initiator, or
speaker.

I especially enjoys the diverse and deep discussion of the
[Software Craft Community](https://softwerkskammer.org/).
