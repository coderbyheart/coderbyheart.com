I'm constantly trying to improve the community I am part of. Since 2012 I've
volunteered and initiated conferences, barcamps, meetups, events and platforms
that support them:

## Distribute Aid

I am a code contributor at [Distribute Aid](https://distributeaid.org) where I
help build the software that helps aid workers across Europe improve the lives
of newcomers.

> We are always looking for new contributors and maintain an up-to-date
> [Getting Started Guide](https://www.notion.so/CONTRIBUTING-4ba5060441e44925b5e22aa674d4729e).

Here are some posts about my work there:

## Codefreeze

Since 2017 I am helping to make [Codefreeze](https://codefreeze.fi/) the
[most amazing software conference in the world](https://coderbyheart.com/codefreeze-brings-the-magic-of-socrates-to-lapland/).
Since 2019 there is also a summer-version:
[Codebreeze](https://codebreeze.netlify.com/).

## Meetups

**#techleadsffm**

In 2015 I initated an invite only breakfast club for tech-leads in the RheinMain
area called #techleadsffm. We are currently 20 members and meeting roughly every
month.

**[Webmontag Offenbach](http://wemoof.github.io/www-jekyll/)**

This event was born out of the idea that the digital scene in my hometown
Offenbach needed its own place to connect. From 2013 to 2015 I organized and
hosted 12 events, which were inspired by
[Frankfurt's Webmontag](https://wmfra.de/).

**[Founders table Frankfurt/RheinMain](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Grunderstammtisch-Founders-Table-FrankfurtRheinMain/)**

In 2012 I co-founded the founders table Frankfurt/RheinMain to provide a
continuous meeting point for the start-ups and future founders in our region
which I co-organized until 2013. It's still active and the biggest meetup group
in the region.

**[Webmontag Frankfurt](https://wmfra.de/)**

Once in a while I helped with the check-in at one of Frankfurt's oldest tech
events.

**[Python Usergroup RheinMain](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Python-User-Group-Rhein-Main/)**

I initated the Python Usergroup RheinMain (PyUGRM) in 2012 and organized 7
events until 2013. It is still active until today.

## BarCamps

**[BarCamp RheinMain](https://barcamp-rheinmain.de)**

From 2013 to 2016 I was in charge of the homepage and ran the registration and
the check-in during the event and developed a custom event management software
which enables participants to complete the check-in within a few seconds.

**[Leancamp Frankfurt](http://www.leancamp.net/frankfurt.html)**

In 2016 I helped to organize two LeanCamp events in Frankfurt.

**[Augenhöhe Camp](http://augenhoehe-camp.de/)**

In 2016 I helped organize the Augenhöhe Camp Frankfurt.

## Events

**[TechWomen Norway](https://techwomen.no/ada-lovelace-day-2019.html)**

In 2019 I helped to organize the _Ada Lovelace mini-conference_ and the
presentation of the 2019 Tech Role Models, which took place in Oslo.

**[RheinMain Tech Cabal](https://github.com/coderbyheart/blog/blob/gh-pages/rheinmain-tech-cabal.md)**

In 2017 I organized and hosted an invite-only event for tech people that aims to
provide a safe space to engage in deep conversations.

**[Gründerboutique](https://twitter.com/grndrbtq)**

In 2013 I co-organized two invite only startup events, where 15 people worked on
startup ideas.

**Startup Weekend RheinMain 2014**

At the second Startup Weekend in the RheinMain region I helped the teams as a
coach and supported them throughout the weekend to create an compelling pitch
for their ideas.

**[TEDx RheinMain](http://hello.tedxrheinmain.de/)**

In 2012 and 2013 I helped organize the TEDxRheinMain. My role included
on-location event registration and general support.

## Platforms

**[Homeferences](https://homeferences.netlify.app/)**

A list of conferences that can be attended online.

**[#RheinMainRocks](https://t.co/U5I9KmGd27)**

A _hashtag_ where a lot of the activities that happen are shared. I did create
the [@rmrocksco](https://twitter.com/rmrocksco) and build tools which
automatically curate its tweets. I also ran a
[crowd-funding campaing to print stickers](https://coderbyheart.com/rheinmainrocks-sticker/)
which were distributed at events in the region.

**[UGRM](https://github.com/rheinmainrocks/ugrm-data)**

A website that collected information and events of technology usergroups in
RheinMain. The data was managed through pull-requests by the community itself.
The project was discontinued in 2017 since Meetup has become the defacto
standard for usergroups.

## Coworking

In 2013 I've initiated the first Coworking Space in my hometown Offenbach, near
Frankfurt, to provide the backbone for developing creative and tech scene in the
city. It was called [OFfenraum](https://twitter.com/offenraum) and you can read
more about it in German
